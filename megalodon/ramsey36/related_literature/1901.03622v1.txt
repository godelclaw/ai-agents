Gallai-Ramsey number for K5

January 14, 2019

Abstract
Given a graph H, the k-colored Gallai Ramsey number grk (K3 : H)
is defined to be the minimum integer n such that every k-coloring of the
edges of the complete graph on n vertices contains either a rainbow triangle or a monochromatic copy of H. Fox et al. [J. Fox, A. Grinshpun,
and J. Pach. The Erdős-Hajnal conjecture for rainbow triangles. J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 111:75-125, 2015.] conjectured the value of the Gallai
Ramsey numbers for complete graphs. Recently, this conjecture has been
verified for the first open case, when H = K4 .
In this paper we attack the next case, when H = K5 . Surprisingly it turns out, that the validity of the conjecture depends upon the
(yet unknown) value of the Ramsey number R(5, 5). It is known that
43 ≤ R(5, 5) ≤ 48 and conjectured that R(5, 5) = 43 [B.D. McKay and
S.P. Radziszowski. Subgraph counting identities and Ramsey numbers.
J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 69:193-209, 1997]. If 44 ≤ R(5, 5) ≤ 48, then
Fox et al.’s conjecture is true and we present a complete proof. If, however, R(5, 5) = 43, then Fox et al.’s conjecture is false, meaning that
at least one of these two conjectures must be false. For the case when
R(5, 5) = 43, we show lower and upper bounds for the Gallai Ramsey
number grk (K3 : K5 ).

Introduction

Given a graph G and a positive integer k, the k-color Ramsey number rk (G)
is the minimum number of vertices n such that every k-coloring of the edges
of KN for N ≥ n must contain a monochromatic copy of G. We refer to [11]
for a dynamic survey of known Ramsey numbers. As a restricted version of the
Ramsey number, the k-color Gallai-Ramsey number grk (K3 : G) is defined to
be the minimum integer n such that every k-coloring of the edges of KN for

N ≥ n must contain a either a rainbow triangle or a monochromatic copy of
G. We refer to [3] for a dynamic survey of known Gallai-Ramsey numbers. In
particular, the following was recently conjectured for complete graphs.
Conjecture 1 ([2]). For k ≥ 1 and p ≥ 3,
(
(r(p) − 1)k/2 + 1
grk (K3 : Kp ) =
(p − 1)(r(p) − 1)(k−1)/2 + 1

if k is even,
if k is odd.

The case where p = 3 was actually verified in 1983 by Chung and Graham
[1]. A simplified proof was given by Gyárfás et al. [6].
Theorem 1 ([1]). For k ≥ 1,
grk (K3 : K3 ) =

(

5k/2 + 1
2 · 5(k−1)/2 + 1

if k is even,
if k is odd.

The next case, where p = 4, was proven in [7].
Theorem 2. For k ≥ 1,
(
17k/2 + 1
grk (K3 : K4 ) =
3 · 17(k−1)/2 + 1

if k is even,
if k is odd.

Our main result is to essentially prove Conjecture 1 in the case where p = 5.
This result is particularly interesting since r(K5 , K5 ) is still not known. Let
R = r(K5 , K5 ) − 1 and note that the known bounds on this Ramsey number
give us 42 ≤ R ≤ 47.
Theorem 3. For any integer k ≥ 2,
(
Rk/2 + 1
grk (K3 : K5 ) =
4 · R(k−1)/2 + 1

if k is even,
if k is odd

unless R = 42, in which case we have


grk (K3 : K5 ) = 43
42k/2 + 1 ≤ grk (K3 : K5 ) ≤ 43k/2 + 1


169 · 42(k−3)/2 + 1 ≤ grk (K3 : K5 ) ≤ 4 · 43(k−1)/2 + 1

if k = 2,
if k ≥ 4 is even,
if k ≥ 3 is odd.

Theorem 3 is proven in Section 4. Note that if R = 43, then Theorem 3
implies that Conjecture 1 is false.
Also recall the following well known conjecture about the sharp value for the
2-color Ramsey number of K5 .
Conjecture 2 ([10]). R(K5 , K5 ) = 43.

By Theorem 3, it turns out that at least one of Conjecture 1 or Conjecture 2
must be false.
In order to prove Theorem 3, we actually prove a more refined version, stated
in Theorem 4. Note that Theorem 3 follows from Theorem 4 by setting r = k,
s = 0 and t = 0.
To simplify the notation, we let c1 denote the case where r, s, t are all even,
c2 denote the case where r, s are both even and t is odd, and so on for c3 , . . . , c11 .

For ease of notation, let g(r, s, t) be the value of grk (K3 : rK5 , sK4 , tK3 )
claimed above. Also, for each i with 1 ≤ i ≤ 11, let gi (r, s, t) = g(r, s, t) − 1 in
the case where (ci ) holds.

Preliminaries

In this section, we recall some known results and provide several helpful lemmas
that will be used in the proof. First we state the main tool for looking at colored
complete graphs with no rainbow triangle.
3

Theorem 5 ([4]). In any coloring of a complete graph containing no rainbow triangle, there exists a nontrivial partition of the vertices (called a Gallai-partition)
such that there are at most two colors on the edges between the parts and only
one color on the edges between each pair of parts.
In light of this result, a colored complete graph with no rainbow triangle is
called a Gallai coloring and the partition resulting from Theorem 5 is called a
Gallai partition.
Next recall some useful Ramsey numbers.
Theorem 6 ([5]).
R(K3 , K5 ) = 14.
Theorem 7 ([9]).
R(K4 , K5 ) = 25.
Also a general lower bound for Gallai-Ramsey numbers, a special case of
the main result in [8]. We will present a more refined construction later for the
purpose of proving Theorem 4.
Lemma 1 ([8]). For a connected complete graph H of order n and an integer
k ≥ 2, we have
(
(R(H, H) − 1)k/2 + 1
if k is even,
grk (K3 : H) ≥
(n − 1) · (R(H, H) − 1)(k−1)/2 + 1 if k is odd.
We next present several tables of values which concisely capture computations that will be used throughout the proof. Each cell contains the ratio of
the corresponding type g(r1 , s1 , t1 ) in relation to the order of the whole graph
g(r, s, t) in the given case. For example, the top left cell of Table 1 contains the
value of the ratio
g(r, s, t − 1)
g(r, s, t)
in the case (c1 ).
Each row of the following tables represents a case (perhaps with some subcases) and each column represents a Type, one of the referenced inequalities
listed above it. In some cells containing two values, these values correspond to
the extra assumptions listed in the far right column. The cases marked with −
do not occur because of base assumptions. The maximum value in each column
yields an upper bound on the ratio for that type over all the cases, and these
are displayed in Inequalities (1)-(22).

Next we provide several lemmas specific to the proof of Theorem 3 but first
some definitions.
We call a part X of a Gallai partition free, if it contains neither red nor blue
edges. We call a part red (blue) if it contains red (respectively blue) edges, but
no red (blue) copy of a K3 , and no blue (red) edges. Note that these notations
do not characterize all parts since clearly a part X might fall into none of these
categories.
Let H be a Gallai colored complete graph where red and blue are the colors
appearing on edges of the reduced graph. We call such a graph (or part of the
partition) H a (Ri , Bj )-graph if it contains neither a red copy of Ki nor a blue
copy of Kj .
Let wi,j (H) = |H|
|G| be the weight of H as a subgraph of an (Ri , Bj )-graph G.
For convenience, when a part A of a Gallai partition of H is assumed, let HR
(and HB ) denote the sets of vertices in H \ A with all red (respectively blue)
edges to A.
For (R3 , B3 )-graphs, we get the following.
Lemma 2. Let H be an (R3 , B3 )-graph, whose parts are either free, red, or
blue. Then w5,5 (H) ≤ 6.5
R .
Proof. In order to avoid a red or blue triangle, the graph H has t ≤ 5 =
5
R(3, 3)−1 parts. If all parts are free, then w5,5 (H) ≤ Rt ≤ R
by Inequality (22).
Suppose H has a red part (and note that a symmetric argument also works for
a blue part). Then HR is empty and HB contains no blue edges. If all parts of
2
by Inequality (22) since there can be at most
HB are free, then w5,5 (HB ) ≤ R
two parts in HB (with all red edges in between them). On the other hand, if HB
contains a red part, then w5,5 (HB ) ≤ 3.25
R by Inequality (21) since H consists of
two red parts joined by blue edges. In either case, we have w5,5 (H) ≤ 6.5
R .
For (R3 , B4 )-graphs, we get the following.
Lemma 3. Let H be a (R3 , B4 )-graph, whose parts are either free, red, or blue.
Then
(i) w5,5 (H) ≤ 9.75
R , and furthermore

all parts are free, then w5,5 (H) ≤ Rt ≤ R
by Inequality (22). Suppose first
that H contains no red parts. Let X1 be a blue part, so w5,5 (X1 ) = 3.25

Inequality (21). Then HR is an (R2 , B4 )-graph and HB is an (R3 , B2 )-graph.

The sharpness of Lemma 3 is given by the following examples:
(1) Three red parts joined by blue edges
(2) Two blue parts joined by red edges, which are joined by blue edges with a
red part
For (R5 , B3 )-graphs, we get the following.
Lemma 4. Let H be an (R5 , B3 )-graph, whose parts are either free, red or blue.
Then
(i) w5,5 (H) ≤ 13
R if H contains only free parts;

R
(iv) w5,5 (H) ≤ 14.5

(v) w5,5 (H) ≤ 13.5
R if H contains exactly two red parts and they are joined by
blue edges;
(vi) w5,5 (H) ≤ 16.25
R .
Proof. Since H is an (R5 , B3 )-graph, H has t ≤ 13 = R(5, 3) − 1 parts. If all
parts are free, then w5,5 (H) ≤ Rt ≤ 13
R by Inequality (22). This proves (i) and
means that we may assume that H contains at least one red or blue part.
Suppose first that H contains a blue part X1 , so w5,5 (X1 ) ≤ 3.25
R by Inequality (21). Then HB is empty and HR is an (R4 , B3 )-graph. By Lemma 3 (and
symmetry of red and blue) we obtain
w5,5 (H) = w5,5 (X1 ) + w5,5 (HR ) ≤

This shows (ii) and means that we may assume H contains no blue parts for

Suppose next that H contains exactly one red part X1 . Then HR has at
most R(3, 3) − 1 = 5 parts, HB has at most R(5, 2) − 1 = 4 parts, and each of
these parts must be free. By Inequalities (21) and (22), this gives

Next suppose there are at least two red parts X1 and X2 but no two red
parts joined by blue edges. With only red edges between the red parts, there can
only be two such parts. Then HR (with respect to X1 ) contains only free parts
other than X2 and HB also contains only free parts. As in (iii), HR has at most
R(3, 3)− 1 = 5 parts, HB has at most R(5, 2)− 1 = 4 parts. By Inequalities (21)

X2 but no blue edges at all so there can be at most 3 total parts in HB . By
Inequalities (21) and (22), this means

Then w4,5 (H) ≤ 29 .

Then

(ii) w4,5 (H) ≤ 31 otherwise.

Figure 1: The structure of H with solid edges being blue and dashed edges

Proof. This proof is very similar to the proof of Lemma 3. Since H is an

Suppose first that H contains no red parts but does contain at least one blue
part. Let X1 be a blue part, so w4,5 (X1 ) = 19 by Inequality (15). Then HR is an
(R2 , B4 )-graph and HB is an (R3 , B2 )-graph. Since HB contains no blue edge
and there are no red parts, HB must contain at most 2 parts and these must be
2
by Inequality (16). Since HR contains no red edge, there
free so w4,5 (HB ) ≤ 24
can be either at most three parts in HR that are all free (with all blue edges in

Therefore, in order for w4,5 (H) > 3 , H must have the structure pictured in

Finally suppose H contains a red part X1 . Then HR is empty and HB is an

unique 2-coloring of K5 with no monochromatic triangle, or

Proof. Since H is an (R5 , B3 )-graph, there are at most R(5, 3) − 1 = 13 parts

First suppose H contains a blue part X1 . Then HB is empty and HR is an

We may therefore assume H contains no blue part.

9
and at least one free part, so HB (defined in terms of X1 ) contains no blue edges

are all free (with all red edges in between them), or one red part and two free
parts, or two red parts. By Inequalities (15) and (16), this means

Three Colors

In this section, we discuss a lower bound example that leads to a counterexample
to either Conjecture 1 or Conjecture 2.
Lemma 8. There exists a 3-colored copy of K169 which contains no rainbow
triangle and no monochromatic copy of K5 .
Proof. Let Grb be a sharpness example on 13 vertices for the Ramsey number
R(K3 , K5 ) = 14 say using colors red and blue respectively. Such an example as
Grb is 4-regular in red and 8-regular in blue. Similarly, let Grg be a copy of the
same graph with all blue edges replaced by green edges. We construct the desired
graph G by making 13 copies of each vertex in Grb and for each set of copies
(corresponding to a vertex), insert a copy of Grg . If an edge uv in Grb is red
(respectively blue), then all edges in G between the two inserted copies of Grg
corresponding to u and v are colored red (respectively blue). Then G contains
no rainbow triangle by construction but also contains no monochromatic K5 .
Since |G| = 169, this provides the desired example.
Note that if R(K5 , K5 ) = 43 so R = 42, then Conjecture 1 claims that
gr3 (K3 : K5 ) = 169 but this example refutes this claim. On the other hand,
if R(K5 : K5 ) > 43, then the conjecture holds for K5 , as proven in Section 4
below.

4

Proof of Theorem 4 (and Theorem 3)

Note that the lower bound for Theorem 3 follows from Lemma 1 and was also
presented in [2] but the lower bound for Theorem 4 must be more detailed.
Proof. For the lower bounds, use the following constructions. For all constructions, we start with an i-colored base graph Gi (constructed below) and inductively suppose we have constructed an i-colored graph Gi containing no rainbow
14

triangle an no appropriately colored monochromatic cliques. For each two unused colors requiring a K5 , we construct Gi+2 by making R copies of Gi , adding
all edges in between the copies to form a blow-up of a sharpness example for
r(K5 , K5 ) on R vertices. For each two unused colors requiring a K4 , we construct Gi+2 by making 17 copies of Gi , adding all edges in between the copies
to form a blow-up of a sharpness example for r(K4 , K4 ) on 17 vertices. For
each two unused colors requiring a K3 , we construct Gi+2 by making 5 copies
of Gi , adding all edges in between the copies to form a blow-up of the sharpness
example for r(K3 , K3 ) on 5 vertices.
The base graphs for this construction are constructed by case as follows.
For Case (c1 ), the base graph G0 is a single vertex. For Case (c2 ), the base
graph G1 is a monochromatic copy of K2 . For Case (c3 ), the base graph G1 is
a monochromatic copy of K3 . For Case (c4 ), the base graph G1 is a monochromatic K4 . For Case (c5 ), the base graph G2 is a sharpness example on 8 vertices
for r(K3 , K4 ) = 9. For Case (c6 ), the base graph G2 is a sharpness example
on 13 vertices for r(K3 , K5 ) = 14. For Case (c7 ), the base graph G3 is two
copies of a sharpness example for r(K3 , K4 ) = 9 with all edges in between the
copies having a third color. For Case (c8 ), the base graph G2 is a sharpness
example on 24 vertices for r(K4 , K5 ) = 25. For Case (c9 ), the base graph G3
is two copies of a sharpness example on 13 vertices for r(K3 , K5 ) = 14. For
Case (c10 ), the base graph G3 is two copies of a sharpness example on 24 vertices for r(K4 , K5 ) = 25 with all edges in between the copies having a third
color. For Case (c11 ), the base graph G3 is three copies of a sharpness example
on 24 vertices for r(K4 , K5 ) = 25 with all edges in between the copies having
a third color. These base graphs and the corresponding completed constructions contain no rainbow triangle and no appropriately colored monochromatic
cliques.
For the upper bound, let G be a Gallai coloring of Kn where n is given in
the statement. We prove this result by induction on 3r + 2s + t, meaning that
it suffices to either reduce the order of a desired monochromatic subgraph or
eliminate a color. Consider a Gallai partition of G and let q be the number of
parts in this partition. Choose such a partition so that q is minimized.
Claim 1. We may assume that q ≥ 4.
Proof. For a contradiction, suppose q ≤ 3. If q = 3, then the reduced graph is
a 2-colored triangle, which contains two edges of the same color. This means
that there is a bipartition of the vertices so that all edges in between have one
color, contradicting the minimality of q. Thus, assume q = 2. Let red be the
color between the two sets, A and B.
First suppose that red is among the last t colors, so we hope to find a red
triangle. To avoid a red triangle, there must be no red edges within A or B. By
induction on 3r + 2s + t and using Inequality (1), we get
|G| = |A| + |B| ≤ 2[g(r, s, t − 1)] = g(r, s, t) < |G|,
a contradiction.
15

Next suppose that red is among the middle s colors, so we hope to find a red
K4 . To avoid a red K4 , only one of A or B can have any red edges. Suppose A
is allowed to have red edges so B is not. Then observe that A cannot contain a
red triangle as this would also create a red K4 . Thus, by induction on 3r + 2s+ t
and using Inequalities (3) and (4) respectively, we get
|G| = |A| + |B| ≤ g(r, s − 1, t + 1) + g(r, s − 1, t) < g(r, s, t) < |G|,
a contradiction.
Finally suppose red is among the first r colors, so we hope to find a red K5 .
Supposing that the red clique number within A is at least as large as the red
clique number within B, we get the following requirements:
• A contains no red K4 , and
• if A contains a red K3 , then B contains no red edges.
These leave only two options:
1. A and B both may contain red edges but no red K3 , or
2. A contains a red K3 (but no red K4 ) and B contains no red edges.
For the first option, we remove 1 from r but add 1 to t within both A and
B. By induction on 3r + 2s + t and using Inequality (11), we get
|G| = |A| + |B| ≤ 2g(r − 1, s, t + 1) < g(r, s, t) < |G|,
a contradiction.
For the second option, we remove 1 from r in both A and B but add 1 to s
in A. By induction on 3r + 2s + t and using Inequalities (9) and (12), we get
|G| = |A| + |B| ≤ g(r − 1, s + 1, t) + g(r − 1, s, t) < g(r, s, t) < |G|,
a contradiction. This completes the proof of Claim 1.
Let D be the reduced graph of the Gallai partition, with vertices wi corresponding to parts Gi of the partition. Let Vr denote the set of vertices in
D whose corresponding sets in the partition contain at least one red edge and
let Vb denote the set of vertices in D whose corresponding sets in the partition
contain at least one blue edge. Let p2 = |Vr ∩ Vb | be the number of parts containing at least one red and at least one blue edge, p1 = |Vr △Vb | be the number
of parts containing at least one red edge or at least one blue edge but not both,
and p0 = |V (D) \ (Vr ∪ Vb )| be the number of parts with no red or blue edges.
For each vertex wi ∈ D, let dr (wi ) and db (wi ) denote its red and blue degrees
respectively within D. Then dr (wi ) + db (wi ) = q − 1 for all i. By the choice
of the Gallai partition with the smallest number of parts, the following fact is
immediate.
Fact 1. For all wi ∈ V (D), we have dr (wi ), db (wi ) ≥ 1.
16

To avoid a monochromatic copy of K5 , the following facts follow immediately
from the relevant definitions.
Fact 2. If wi ∈ D is in a red K4 ⊆ D, then wi ∈
/ Vr . If wi ∈ D is in a blue
K4 ⊆ D, then wi ∈
/ Vb .
Fact 3. For all i,
dr (wi ) ≤ 24, and db (wi ) ≤ 24.
If a vertex wi ∈ D has at least r(3, 5) = 14 incident edges in red (in D), then
the neighborhood contains either a red K3 or a blue K5 . Certainly the latter is
not an option so the former must occur, meaning that wi is contained in a red
K4 within D. By Fact 2, we get the following fact.
Fact 4. If dr (wi ) ≥ 14, then wi ∈
/ Vr . If db (wi ) ≥ 14, then wi ∈
/ Vb .
The remainder of the proof is broken into cases based on where red and blue
fall in the list of colors relative to the first r colors, the middle s colors, and the
last t colors.
Case 1. Both red and blue occur within the last t colors.
In this case, the graph G contains no red or blue triangle. Since r(K3 , K3 ) =
6, we find that 4 ≤ q ≤ 5. By Fact 1, for every i, it follows that Gi contains no
red or blue edge. This means that every Gi is colored with at most k − 2 colors
with
|Gi | ≤ g(r, s, t − 2).
By induction and Inequality (2),
|G| =

q
X

|Gi | ≤ 5g(r, s, t − 2) ≤ g(r, s, t) < |G|,

1=1

a contradiction, completing the proof of Case 1.
Case 2. Red is among the middle s colors while blue is among the last t colors.
In this case, the graph G contains no red K4 and no blue triangle. Since
r(K4 , K3 ) = 9, we find that 4 ≤ q ≤ 8. By Fact 1, for every i, it follows that Gi
contains no blue edge and no red triangle.
If Gi contains no red edges for some i, then Gi is colored with at most k − 2
colors with |Gi | ≤ g(r, s − 1, t − 1) so by induction and Inequality (5),
|Gi | ≤ g(r, s − 1, t − 1) ≤

1
g(r, s, t).
8

(23)

Next if Gi contains at least one red edge, then by Fact 1, there can be no red
triangle in Gi so |Gi | ≤ g(r, s − 1, t). Therefore, by the induction hypothesis
and Inequality (4), we have
|Gi | ≤ g(r, s − 1, t) ≤
17

1
g(r, s, t).

(26)

then we obtain a contradiction by showing |G| ≤ g(r, s, t). The remainder of
this case can be concluded by establishing Inequality (26), which follows by the
same argument as used in the corresponding case of [7].
Case 3. Both red and blue occur within the middle s colors.
In this case, the graph G contains no red or blue K4 and cases (c4 ) and
(c9 ) cannot occur since s ≥ 2. Since r(K4 , K4 ) = 18, we find that 4 ≤ q ≤ 17.
First some bounds on the orders of the parts Gi , leading to a counterpart of
Inequality 25.
First suppose Gi contains no red and no blue edges. Then by induction and
Inequality (8), imply that
1
g(r, s, t).
(27)
17
Next suppose Gi contains no blue edges but contains some red edges. Then by
induction and Inequality (7), we get
|Gi | ≤ g(r, s − 2, t) =

13
g(r, s, t).
(28)
72
Finally suppose Gi contains both red and blue edges. Then by induction and
Inequality (6), we get
|Gi | ≤ g(r, s − 2, t + 1) ≤

|Gi | ≤ g(r, s − 2, t + 2) =

13
g(r, s, t).

Combining Inequalities (27), (28), and (29), we obtain the key inequality

36
72
17
then we will arrive at a contradiction that |G| ≤ g(r, s, t). Thus, for the remainder of the proof of this case, it suffices to show Inequality (31).
Next we derive several facts. Within the red neighborhood of some vertex
wi in R, there can be no red triangle since otherwise we would have a red K4
in G. There can also be no blue K4 within this neighborhood so that means
the red neighborhood of wi (and similarly the blue neighborhood) has at most
r(4, 3) − 1 = 8 vertices. Formally, we obtain the following fact.
p2

18

Fact 5. For all wi ∈ V (R), we have dr (wi ), db (wi ) ≤ 8.
If a vertex wi ∈ R is contained in a red (or blue) triangle, then the part
Gi cannot contain any red (respectively blue) edges to avoid creating a red
(respectively blue) copy of K4 . The following fact is then immediate.
Fact 6. If wi is in a red triangle in R, then wi ∈
/ Vr . Similarly if wi is in a
blue triangle in R, then wi ∈
/ Vb .
If dr (wi ) ≥ 4 for some wi ∈ V (R), then the red neighborhood of wi certainly
must contain at least one red edge since otherwise, if all edges were blue, we
would have a blue K4 . Thus wi is in a red triangle in R. A similar observation
holds with the roles of red and blue switched. Thus from Fact 6, we obtain the
following fact.
Fact 7. If dr (wi ) ≥ 4 then wi ∈
/ Vr , and if db (wi ) ≥ 4 then wi ∈
/ Vb .
If two parts Gi and Gj each contain at least one red edge, say ei and ej
respectively, then the edge wi wj in R cannot be red since otherwise the subgraph
induced on the vertices of ei ∪ ej is a red K4 . Thus, we obtain the following
fact.
Fact 8. The subgraph induced on Vr is a blue clique and the subgraph induced
on Vb is a red clique.
Next, we prove three helpful claims about the values of p0 , p1 , and p2 .
Claim 2. p2 = |Vr ∩ Vb | ≤ 1 and if p2 = 1, then q ≤ 7.
Proof. If we have wi , wj ∈ Vr ∩ Vb , then by Fact 8, wi , wj ∈ Vr implies that
the edge wi wj is blue in R, while wi , wj ∈ Vb implies that wi wj is red, a
contradiction.
Now suppose p0 = 1 and, for a contradiction, that q ≥ 8. If w1 ∈ Vr ∩ Vb ,
then there are at least 4 other vertices, say W = {w2 , w3 , w4 , w5 } with all one
color, say red, on edges to w1 . Since w1 ∈ Vr ∩Vb and to avoid a red K4 , all edges
between vertices in W must be blue, forming a blue K4 for a contradiction.
Claim 3. |Vr | + |Vb | ≤ 4.
Proof. Suppose first that there is a vertex wi ∈ Vr ∩ Vb . Then by Fact 6, wi
is contained in neither a red triangle nor a blue triangle within R. By Fact 8,
any vertex of Vr \ {wi } must be a blue neighbor of wi in R, and since the blue
neighborhood of wi induces a red clique in R, again Fact 8 implies that there
can only be at most one vertex in Vr \ {wi }. This means that |Vr | ≤ 2, and
similarly, |Vb | ≤ 2.
Thus, we may assume Vr ∩ Vb = ∅. We next claim that |Vr | ≤ 3 and |Vb | ≤ 3.
If |Vr | ≥ 4, then by Fact 8, the subgraph of R induced on the vertices of Vr
contains a blue K4 , a contradiction. Thus |Vr | ≤ 3, and symmetrically |Vb | ≤ 3.
Now suppose that |Vr | = |Vb | = 3. If there exists a vertex wi ∈ Vr with
at least two red neighbors in Vb , then by Fact 8, wi is in a red triangle in R,
and this contradicts Fact 6. Thus, there can be at most one red edge from each
19

vertex in Vr to Vb , and similarly, at most one blue edge from each vertex in Vb
to Vr , for a total of at most 6 edges. But R has 9 edges between Vr and Vb ,
a contradiction. Finally suppose |Vr | = 3 and |Vb | = 2. Then again, there can
be at most one red edge from each vertex of Vr to Vb , and at most one blue
edge from each vertex of Vb to Vr , for a total of at most 5 edges, while R has 6
edges between Vr and Vb , another contradiction. Symmetrically we cannot have
|Vr | = 2 and |Vb | = 3, thus completing the proof of Claim 3.
Claim 4. If either |Vr | ≥ 2 or |Vb | ≥ 2, then
(a) q ≤ 10,
(b) If q = 10, then p2 = 0 and p1 = 2, and
(c) If q = 9, then p1 + p2 ≤ 3.
In particular, if |Vr | + |Vb | ≥ 3, then either |Vr | ≥ 2 or |Vb | ≥ 2 so this claim
may be applied.
Proof. Working under the assumption that |Vr | + |Vb | ≥ 3, without loss of
generality, we may assume |Vr | ≥ 2. Suppose G1 and G2 each contain at least
one red edge. By Fact 8, all edges from G1 to G2 must be blue. For i with
1 ≤ i ≤ 2, define
Ri

= {j|j ≥ 3, and Gj is joined to Gi by red edges

R1,2

and to G3−i by blue edges}
= {j|j ≥ 3, and Gj is joined to Gi and G3−i by red edges}

B

= {j|j ≥ 3, and Gj is joined to Gi and G3−i by blue edges}

If j1 , j2 ∈ Ri , then Gj1 and Gj2 are joined by blue edges to avoid a red K4 .
Suppose that |Ri | ≥ 3 for some i, say |R1 | ≥ 3 with {j1 , j2 , j3 } ⊆ R1 . Then
there is a blue K4 with vertices chosen from G2 , Gj1 , Gj2 , Gj3 , a contradiction.
This means that |Ri | ≤ 2 for each i with 1 ≤ i ≤ 2.
If j1 , j2 ∈ Ri ∪ R1,2 , then again Gj1 and Gj2 are joined by blue edges to
avoid a red K4 . Then to avoid a blue K4 , it is clear that |R1,2 | + |Ri | ≤ 3 for
each i with 1 ≤ i ≤ 2. Exchanging the roles of the colors, it is also clear that
|B| ≤ 3.
Then if:
• |R1,2 | = 0, then |R1,2 | + |R1 | + |R2 | + |B| ≤ 0 + 2 · 2 + 3 = 7,
• |R1,2 | = 1, then |R1,2 | + |R1 | + |R2 | + |B| ≤ 1 + 2 · 2 + 3 = 8,
• |R1,2 | = 2, then |R1,2 | + |R1 | + |R2 | + |B| ≤ 2 + 2 · 1 + 3 = 7,
• |R1,2 | = 3, then |R1,2 | + |R1 | + |R2 | + |B| ≤ 3 + 2 · 0 + 3 = 6,
20

so in every case, q = 2 + |R1,2 | + |R1 | + |R2 | + |B| ≤ 2 + 8 = 10, completing the
proof of (a).
If q = 10, then we must have |R1,2 | + |R1 | + |R2 | + |B| = 1 + 2 · 2 + 3 = 8
so |R1,2 | = 1, |R1 | = |R2 | = 2 and |B| = 3. By the observations above, all
edges between pairs of parts with indices in B are red, meaning that each of
these parts is in a red triangle in R. Similarly, all edges between pairs of parts
with indices in R1,2 ∪ Ri are blue for each i with 1 ≤ i ≤ 2, meaning that each
of these parts is in a blue triangle in R. Thus, for all j with 3 ≤ j ≤ 10, we
have Gj contains no red or blue edges. Similarly, with Ri = 2 for each i, there
can be no blue edges in either G1 or G2 . This means that p2 = 0 and p1 = 2,
completing the proof of (b).
Finally suppose q = 9. What remains of the proof of Claim 4, we break into
cases based on the value of |R1,2 |.
If |R1,2 | = 0, then |R1 | = |R2 | = 2 and |B| = 3. As in the case when q = 10,
G1 and G2 each contain no blue edges and for all j with 3 ≤ j ≤ 10, Gj must
contain no red or blue edges. Thus, p2 = 0 and p1 = 2.
If |R1,2 | = 1, then it is possible that either |R1 | = 1 or |R2 | = 1, say |R1 | = 1.
Then the set Gj corresponding to R1 can have blue edges but all other sets Gj
with j ≥ 3 must have no blue and no red edges. Thus, p1 + p2 ≤ 3. On the
other hand, if |R1 | = |R2 | = 2, then it is possible that |B| = 2. Then at most
one of the sets Gj corresponding to B can have red edges but all other sets Gj
with j ≥ 3 must have no blue and no red edges. Thus, p1 + p2 ≤ 3.
If |R1,2 | = 2, then |R1 | = |R2 | = 1 and |B| = 3. Each of the sets with indices
in R1 ∪ R2 ∪ R1,2 is contained in a blue triangle in R, meaning that for all j
with 3 ≤ j ≤ 10, the set Gj contains no red or blue edges. Each set G1 and G2
may contain blue edges or not but in either case, p1 + p2 = 2, completing the
proof of (c) and Claim 4.
We now consider subcases based on the value of q.
Subcase 3.1. 13 ≤ q ≤ 17.
By Fact 5, we have dr (wi ), db (wi ) ≤ 8 so this means that db (wi ), dr (wi ) ≥ 4
for all wi ∈ V (R). This means that Gi contains no red or blue edges for all i.
Thus p2 = p1 = 0, p0 = q, and

as required for Inequality (31).
Subcase 3.2. 4 ≤ q ≤ 10.
By Claim 2, we have p2 ≤ 1. First suppose p2 = 1. Then if q ≥ 8, every
vertex wi ∈ V (R) must have at least 4 edges in one color and, by Fact 7, every set
Gi is missing either red or blue, contradicting the assumption that p2 = 1. Thus,
21

we have 4 ≤ q ≤ 7. By Claim 3, since p2 = 1, we have p1 = |Vr | + |Vb | − 2p2 ≤ 2.

completing the proof of this subcase, and the proof of Case 3.
Case 4. Red is among the first r colors while blue is among the last t colors.
In this case, the graph G contains no red K5 and no blue triangle. Since
r(K3 , K5 ) = 14, we find that 4 ≤ q ≤ 13. By Fact 1, each part of the Gallai
partition has both red and blue incident edges in the reduced graph. This
means that there can be no red K4 and no blue edge in any part, leading to the
following main subcases.
1. No part has any red edges,
2. There is a part with a red K3 , and
3. There is a part with red edges but no part has a red K3 .
We first consider Subcase 1. Since every part Gi contains no red or blue
edges, this means that |Gi | ≤ g(r − 1, s, t− 1). By induction and Inequality (13),
we get
|G| =

a contradiction, completing the proof of Subcase 1.
22

Next we consider Subcase 2. Let G1 be a part of the Gallai partition containing a red triangle. Partition the remaining vertices of G into GR and GB such
that GR contains all vertices in parts having red edges to G1 and GB contains
all vertices in parts having blue edges to G1 .
Certainly GR contains no red edges and no blue triangle and GB contains
no red K5 and no blue edges. This means that
|GR | ≤ g(r − 1, s, t)

and

|GB | ≤ g(r, s, t − 1).

Furthermore, since G1 contains a red triangle but no red K4 and no blue edges,
we get
|G1 | ≤ g(r − 1, s + 1, t − 1).
By considering each of the cases of the statement ((c1 ) up to (c11 )) individually across Types T1, T10, and T12 in Tables 1 and 2, we see that in each of
the cases, we have
g(r − 1, s + 1, t − 1) + g(r − 1, s, t) + g(r, s, t − 1) ≤ g(r, s, t)
except in the two cases (c7 ) and (c10 ). We sharpen the bounds by observing
that G1 contains a red triangle, so every pair of parts in GR are joined by blue
edges. Since G has no blue triangle, this means that GR must have at most two
parts. If GR has only one part, then by Fact 1, it must have blue edges to some
part in GB , and so cannot contain a blue edge so |GR | ≤ g(r − 1, s, t − 1). If
GR has two parts, then similarly each cannot contain blue edges meaning that
|GR | ≤ 2g(r − 1, s, t − 1). Then the calculations for these two specific cases
become
221
(c7 ) : 2 R3 + 16R
+ 12 < 1, and
1
2
+ 17
(c10 ) : 15
48 + 2 < 1.

In either case, |G| = |G1 | + |GR | + |GB | < |G|, a contradiction.
Finally we consider Subcase 3. Let G1 be a part of the Gallai partition
containing at least one red edge (but no red triangle). Again partition the
remaining vertices of G into GR and GB such that GR contains all vertices in
parts having red edges to G1 and GB contains all vertices in parts having blue
edges to G1 .
Then GR contains no red K3 and no blue K3 . Similarly, GB contains no red
K5 and no blue edges at all. This means that
|GR | ≤ g(r − 1, s, t + 1)

and

|GB | ≤ g(r, s, t − 1).

Furthermore, since G1 contains red edges but no red triangle and no blue edges,
we get
|G1 | ≤ g(r − 1, s, t).
By considering each of the cases of the statement ((c1 ) up to (c11 )) individually
across Types T1, T11, and T12 in Tables 1 and 2, we see that in each of the
23

cases, we have
g(r − 1, s, t + 1) + g(r − 1, s, t) + g(r, s, t − 1)
≤1
g(r, s, t)
except in the two cases (c7 ) and (c9 ).
Certainly GB contains no blue edges so every pair of parts in GB are joined
by red edges. Since G has no red K5 , there must be at most 4 parts in GB . By
Fact 1, no individual part contains a red K4 so if there is only one part in GB , it
has order at most g(r − 1, s + 1, t − 1). If a part Gi ⊆ GB contains a red triangle,
then there can only be one other part, which must have no red edge. In this case
|GB | ≤ g(r − 1, s + 1, t − 1) + g(r − 1, s, t − 1). If two parts have red edges (but no
red triangle), then these are the only two parts in GB and |GB | ≤ 2g(r − 1, s, t).
Finally if one part has red edges (but no red triangle), then there are at most
3 parts in GB , meaning that |GB | ≤ g(r − 1, s, t) + 2g(r − 1, s, t − 1). Putting
these observations together, we see that

|GB | ≤

a contradiction, completing the proof of Case 4.
Case 5. Red is among the first r colors while blue is among the middle s colors.
In this case, the graph G contains no red K5 and no blue K4 . Since
r(K4 , K5 ) = 25, we find that 4 ≤ q ≤ 24. We break the proof into subcases
based on the red and blue edges that appear within parts of a Gallai partition.
These subcases are listed as follows.
5.1. No part of the partition contains any red or blue edges.
5.2. A part G1 contains a red copy of K3 and at least one blue edge.
5.3. A part G1 contains red and blue edges, but no red or blue copy of K3 .
5.4. A part G1 contains a red copy of K3 and no blue edges.
24

5.5. A part G1 contains blue edges.
5.6. A part G1 contains red edges but no red copy of K3 , and no blue edges.
We now consider these subcases.
Subcase 5.1. No part of the partition contains any red or blue edges.
If each part Gi of the partition contains no red or blue edges, then this is
1
Type T16 so by Inequality (16), we get g(r−1,s−1,t)

Subcase 5.2. A part G1 contains a red copy of K3 and at least one blue edge.
Let GR (and GB ) be the set of vertices with all red (respectively blue) edges
to G1 . Then |GB | can be bounded from above by g(r, s−1, t). By Inequality (4),
we get

g(r, s, t)

Finally, since GR contains no red edges, it has at most three parts. No part
has a blue K3 so there can be three parts with no blue edges or one part with

First a claim that there is only one such part.
Claim 5. At most one part contains a red copy of K3 .
Proof. Suppose there are two parts G1 and G2 containing a red copy of K3 . To
avoid a red copy of K5 , there must be all blue edges in between G1 and G2 .
Then GR , the set of vertices with red edges to G1 , is an (R2 , B4 )-graph, and G2
is contained in GB , the set of vertices with all blue edges to G1 . We also see that
the set of vertices in GB with all red edges to G1 , GBR is an (R2 , B3 )-graph, and
the set of vertices in GB with all blue edges to G2 , GBB is an (R5 , B2 )-graph.
We deduce that

For the remaining subcases, we therefore know that each part Gi can contain
red (or blue) edges but no red (respectively blue) copy of K3 , and no blue
(respectively red) edges.
27

Subcase 5.5. A part G1 contains a blue edges.
Suppose G1 contains a blue edge. Let GR (or GB ) denote the set of vertices
in G \ G1 with red (respectively blue) edges to G1 . Let q1 be the number of
parts of the Gallai partition in GR and let q2 be the number of parts of the
Gallai partition in GB . Then
q1 ≤ 17 = R(K4 , K4 ) − 1
since the reduced graph of GR contains no monochromatic copy of K4 . Similarly,
q2 ≤ 4 since GB contains no blue edges.
For the situation when GR contains either red or blue edges, we apply Inequality (15) to get |GR | ≤ g(r − 1, s − 1, t + 1) ≤ 91 g(r, s, t).
We intend to show that
|G| = |G1 | + |GR | + |GB | ≤ g(r, s, t),
which would be a contradiction. This would hold if we could show that
|G1 | + |GB | ≤

Certainly there are no blue edges within GB so every pair of parts in GB is
joined entirely by red edges. Since G contains no red copy of K5 , there can be
at most 4 parts of the Gallai partition in GB . If two parts have red edges (but
certainly no red triangle in this subcase), then these are the only two parts in
GB and if one part has red edges (but no red triangle), then there are at most
3 parts in GB .
This means that

Within GR , we first note that there is no red copy of K4 and no blue copy of
K4 . We may therefore follow along with the proof of Case 3 with the following
arguments, cases concerning the possible values of q1 .
First suppose q1 = 17. If a part in G2 in GB contains a red edge, then since
R(K3 , K4 ) = 9, there must be at most 8 parts in GR with red edges to G2 and
at most 8 parts in GR with blue edgs to G2 , meaning q1 ≤ 16. Thus, no part in
GB has a red edge, so

completing the proof of Subcase 5.5.
For the remaining subcase, all parts are either free or red, and there is at
least one red part.
Subcase 5.6. A part G1 contains red edges but no red copy of K3 , and no blue
edges.
Then GR is an (R3 , B4 )-graph and GB is an (R5 , B3 )-graph. So by Inequality (15) and Lemmas 6 and 7, we obtain

a contradiction, unless GR and GB are both very specific blow-ups of the unique
2-coloring of K5 with no monochromatic triangle as in Lemmas 6 and 7.
In order to avoid creating a red K5 , each part in GR can have red edges
to at most two parts in GB . This means that there must be at least 15 pairs
of parts (one in GR and one in GB ) with blue edges between them. To avoid
creating a blue copy of K4 , the only way for a part in GB to have blue edges
to three parts in GR is for all of those blue edges to go to the free parts in GR .
This leaves all red edges from the blue parts in GR to GB , making a red copy
of K5 , completing the proof of Subcase 5.6 and Case 5.
29

Case 6. Red and blue are both within the first r colors.
In this case, the graph G contains no red or blue K5 . Since r(K5 , K5 ) = R+1,
we find that 4 ≤ q ≤ R. It turns out that a better bound is almost immediate.
Claim 6. If red and blue occur within the first r colors, then
q ≤ 38.
Proof. Suppose, for a contradiction, that q ≥ 39. By Fact 3, for each vertex
wi ∈ D, we have dr (wi ) ≤ 24 and db (wi ) ≤ 24. Since q = |D| ≥ 39, this means
that dr (wi ) ≥ 14 and db (wi ) ≥ 14. By Fact 4, we get that Vr = ∅ and Vb = ∅,
so p0 = q. By induction on the number of colors,
|Gi | ≤
so this means that
|G| ≤

g(r, s, t) < |G|,

a contradiction.
We break the remainder of the proof of this case into the following subcases:
1. There is a part G1 containing a red triangle and a blue triangle but no
red or blue copy of K4 .
2. There is a part G1 containing a red edge and a blue triangle but no red
triangle and no blue copy of K4 .
3. There is a part G1 containing a red edge and a blue edge but no red or
blue triangle. So G1 is an (R3 , B3 )-part.
4. There is an (R2 , B4 )-part G1 .
5. Each part is either a free part or a red part or a blue part.
Subcase 6.1. There is a part G1 containing a red triangle and a blue triangle
but no red or blue copy of K4 .
If we let GR and GB be the sets of vertices with all red or respectively blue
edges to G1 , then it is clear that GR contains no red edges and GB contains no
blue edges. Since all edges between parts in GR must be blue, there can be at
most 4 parts and similar there can be at most 4 parts in GB . Since G1 contains
a red triangle and a blue triangle but no red or blue copy of K4 , we see from
Inequality (17) that
|G1 |
18
≤
.
|G|
R
The orders of GR and GB satisfy identical bounds so, by symmetry, we will
consider only |GR |.
30

If GR contains only one part, this part contains no red edges and perhaps
some blue triangles but no blue copy of K4 (recall that for every part Gi , there
exists a part Gj with all blue edges to Gi ). By Inequality (19), this means that
|GR |/|G| ≤ R6 .
If GR contains two parts, these must have all blue edges between them.
Then either one of these parts contains a blue triangle and the other contains
no blue edges, or each part contains blue edges but no blue triangle. In the
former situation, by Inequalities (22) and (19), we have

Subcase 6.2. There is a part G1 containing a red edge and a blue triangle but
no red triangle and no blue copy of K4 .
Again let GR and GB be the sets of vertices with all red or respectively blue
edges to G1 , so GR contains no red triangle and GB contains no blue edges.
By Inequality (18), we see that |G1 | ≤ 12
R |G|. From the same argument as in
the previous subcase, we see that |GB | ≤ R7 |G|. By Inequality (11), we see that

|GR | ≤ 13

Subcase 6.3. There is an (R3 , B3 )-part G1 .
With GR and GB being the sets of vertices with red or blue edges respectively
to G1 , we consider several possible situations. We further break into cases based
on the surrounding structures.
Subcase 6.3.1. No other part contains red or blue edges.
Then since GB contains no blue triangle and no red copy of K5 , we see
that GB contains at most R(K3 , K5 ) − 1 = 13 parts of the Gallai partition and
similarly GR also contains at most 13 parts of the Gallai partition. This means
that

Subcase 6.3.2. There is a (R2 , B4 )-part G2 .
In order to avoid creating a blue copy of K5 , all edges from G1 to G2 must be
red. Let F2B denote the set of vertices with blue edges to G2 , let F1R denote any
remaining vertices with red edges to G1 and let F1B denote the set of vertices
with blue edges to G1 . Note that F2B contains no blue edges, F1R contains no
red edges since both G1 and G2 have all red edges to F1R , and F1B contains no
blue triangle and no red copy of K4 . This means that

Without loss of generality, suppose the edges between G1 and G2 are red.
If we let F1R denote the set of vertices with red edges to G1 , then all of F1R
must have blue edges to G2 . Let F1B be the remaining vertices, those with blue
edges to G1 . Then F1B contains no blue triangle and F1R contains no blue or
red triangle. This means that

Subcase 6.4. There is an (R2 , B4 )-part G1 .
With GR and GB being the sets of vertices with red or blue edges respectively to G1 , the graph induced on GR contains no blue edge. We consider
several possible situations and further break into cases based on the surrounding structures.
Subcase 6.4.1. No part in GR contains red or blue edges.
Then since GB contains no blue edges and no red copy of K5 , we see that GB
contains at most R(K2 , K5 ) − 1 = 4 parts of the Gallai partition and similarly
GR also contains at most R(K4 , K5 ) − 1 = 24 parts of the Gallai partition. This
means that

Subcase 6.4.2. There is an (R4 , B2 )-part G2 in GR .
Without loss of generality, suppose the edges between G1 and G2 are all red.
Let F1R be the set of vertices (other than G2 ) with red edges to G1 and let F1B
be the set of vertices with blue edges to G1 . Then F1B contains no blue edges
and F1R must have blue edges to G2 to avoid creating a red copy of K5 so F1R
contains no red or blue copy of K4 . This means that

Let GRR be the set of vertices in GR with red edges to G2 and let GRB be
those vertices in GR with blue edges to G2 . Then GB contains no blue edges,
33

GRR contains no red edges, and GRB contains no red or blue copy of K4 . This

Note that we may assume that GB contains no red triangle since if it did,
this structure would be symmetric to the assumed structure considered in Subcase 6.4.2.
Let GRR denote the set of vertices in GR with red edges to G2 and let GRB
denote the set of vertices in GR with blue edges to G2 . Then GB contains no
blue edges and GRB contains no red K4 and no blue triangle.
Hence GRR is an (R3 , B5 )-graph and GRB is a (R4, B3)-graph. Using Lemmas 3 and 4, we obtain

Then all edges between G1 and G2 are red. Let F1B be the set of vertices
with blue edges to G1 , let FRR be the set of vertices with red edges to both G1
and G2 , and let FRB be the set of vertices with red edges to G1 and blue edges
toG2 . Then F1B contains no blue edges and FRB contains no blue edges and
no red K4 . If FRR contains no blue K3 , then FRR is an (R3 , B5 )-graph. This

Subcase 6.5. Each part is either a free part or a red part or a blue part.
First suppose that G has exactly one non-free part. Let G1 be this part
containing red edges. Then GR is an (R3 , B5 )-graph and GB is an (R5 , B4 )graph. So we obtain

Hence we may assume that G contains at least two non-free parts, say G1
and G2 . If G1 and G2 both contain red edges, and G1 and G2 are joined by
blue edges, then we call this a RBR-pair. Analogously, RRR-pairs, RRB-pairs
(BBR-pairs), BBB-pairs, BRB-pairs, and BBR-pairs (RBB)-pairs are defined.
Claim 7. G contains an RRR-pair or a BBB-pair.
Proof. Suppose not. First assume that G contains a RBR-pair. So let G1
and G2 contain red edges and G1 and G2 are joined by blue edges. Then
GR is an (R3 , B5 )-graph, GBB is an (R5 , B3 )-graph and GBR is an (R3 , B4 )graph. Since there is no RRR-pair, both GR and GBR contain no red parts.
Hence w(GBR ) ≤ 9.5
R by Lemma 3 (ii). Now GR can have at most two blue
parts, since otherwise there is a BBB-pair. Now by Lemma 4, we conclude that
13.5
w(GR ) ≤ 13.5

Thus, we obtain

(R3 , B3 )-graph and GB is an (R5 , B4 )-graph.
By the assumptions there are no red parts in GRR , GRB and GB , and no
blue part in GRB . Furthermore, GRR and GB have at most one blue part by
the assumption. So we conclude that

Since R(3, 4) = 9, there is a blue K4 or a red K3 leading to a red K6 , a
contradiction.
(ii) H contains eight red parts and a free part. Now contract every red part
to a red vertex, we obtain a graph H ′ with eight red vertices and a vertex. Now
R(3, 4) = 9 gives a blue K4 or a red K3 with at least two red vertices implying
that there is a red complete subgraph with at least 2 · 2 + 1 = 5 vertices, a
contradiction, completing the proof of Case 6 and Theorem 4.
