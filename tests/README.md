# Tests

This directory contains the test suite for the Megalodon-MeTTa Bridge.

## Structure

- `test_bridge_full.py`: The main test harness.
- `fixtures/tactics/`: Minimal `.mg` files testing specific features.
- `fuzz/`: Generated fuzz corpus (auto-generated by `make fuzz-corpus`).

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests on fixtures
make bridge-test

# Generate and run fuzz tests
make fuzz-corpus
```
