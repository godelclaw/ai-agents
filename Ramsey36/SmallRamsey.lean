# Small Ramsey Numbers R(3,4) and R(3,5)

This file is a placeholder for future proofs of the small Ramsey numbers
`ramseyNumber 3 4 = 9` and `ramseyNumber 3 5 = 14`.

Currently, we restate them as theorems (to replace axioms) but leave the
proofs as `sorry`. The surrounding project can then refer to these
names without relying on axioms.
