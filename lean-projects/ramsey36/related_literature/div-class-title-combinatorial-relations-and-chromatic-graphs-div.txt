COMBINATORIAL RELATIONS AND CHROMATIC
GRAPHS
R. E. GREENWOOD AND A. M. GLEASON

1. Introduction. The following elementary logical problem was a question in
the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition held in March 1953 (1):
Six points are in general position in space (no three in a line, no four in a
plane). The fifteen line segments joining them in pairs are drawn, and
then painted, some segments red, some blue. Prove that some triangle has
all its sides the same color.
This problem may be generalized as follows:
N vertex points are given, and r colors are available. Each of the
%N(N — 1) segments joining two vertices is colored by one and one only
of the r given colors. Find the minimum integer n = n(ki, k2l . . . , kr)
such that, if N > n, either there will exist a subset of ki vertices with all
interconnecting segments of the first color, or there will exist a subset of
k2 vertices with all interconnecting segments of the second color, . . . ,
or there will exist a subset of kr vertices with all interconnecting
segments of the rth color.
The elementary problem is then the special case r = 2, k± = 3, &2 = 3,
and essentially asserts that n(3, 3) < 6. A slightly more general form would
assert that w(3, 3) = 6.
THEOREM 1.

»(3, 3) =

6.

Proof. To show n(3, 3) > 5, consider the five points to be the vertices of
a regular pentagon. Let the two colors be red and blue. Color the edges
red and the interior diagonals blue. In this assemblage of 5 vertices and 10
segments there is no triangle with all its sides the same color.
To show 6 is a sufficient number of vertices, select some one vertex point
and call it a. Of the five line segments terminating at a, select a set of three
all of which have the same color. Consider the three segments joining their
farther ends in pairs. If no one of these segments is of the same color as the
initial set, then all three segments are of the other color and do form a required
triangle.
Note. The second part of the above proof is essentially the same as that
given by one of the Putnam examination candidates.
2. General case for 2 colors. We define
n(l,m) = 1
n(k, 1) = 1

It is easy to see that
n(2, m) — m
»(*, 2) = k

{m = 2, 3, 4, . . .),
(k = 2, 3, 4, . . .)•

The relation w(&, m) = w(m, &) is an obvious consequence of the symmetry
or duality of the problem.
It is possible to establish two inequalities for n(k, m) which are similar in
appearance to a well-known identity for binomial coefficients.
For convenience, a set of vertices K will be said to be a red interconnected
set if all segments joining pairs of vertices in K are colored red. A set of
vertices M will be said to be a blue interconnected set if all segments joining
pairs of vertices in M are colored blue. In the minimum vertex number
n(k, m), the first argument will be used for the red color, and the second argument for the blue color.
THEOREM 2.

n(k,

m) < n(k

— 1, m) + n(k,

m — 1).

Proof. Let T be any set of n(k — 1, m) + n(k, m — 1) vertices. Form a
chromatic graph by coloring each interconnecting segment either red or blue.
Select one vertex and call it a. For vertex a consider the two associated
numbers:
n\ = number of vertices such that the segments joining them to a are red,
n2 = number of vertices such that the segments joining them to a are blue.
Call these sets of vertices 7 \ and T2.
Since all vertices other than a belong to either 7 \ or T2, one obtains
n\ + n2 + 1 = n(k — 1, m) + n(k, m — 1).
If n\ < n(Jk — \,m), then ^2 > n(k, m — 1) and one selects the set T2.
In T2 there is either a red interconnected set Si with k vertices or a blue interconnected set S2 with m — 1 vertices. If the latter holds, the set {5*2 + vertex
a} is a blue interconnected set with m vertices. Hence the inequality of
Theorem 2 is established for this case.
If n\ > n(k — 1, m), one selects the set T\. In 7 \ there is either a red
interconnected set S% with k — 1 vertices or a blue interconnected set 54
with m vertices. In the first case the set {S3 + vertex a] is seen to be a red
interconnected set with k vertices. The proof of Theorem 2 is now complete.
COROLLARY

By an obvious extension of this argument one may prove:
COROLLARY 2.

For the case of more than two colors,

n(ku k2,. . . , kT) < n(ki — 1, k2l...

, kr) + n(ki, k2 — 1, . . . , kr)
+ n(ki, k2, . . . , kr — 1).

— 1) = 2q,then

n(k, m) < 2p + 2q = n(& — 1, m) + ^(&> w — 1).
Proof. Take a set of 2£ + 2g — 1 vertices. Select one vertex and call it a.
There are 2p + 2g — 2 segments terminating at a. Three possibilities might
arise :
(a) 2p or more segments terminating at a are red,
(b) 2q or more segments are blue, or
(c) 2p — 1 segments are red and 2q — 1 segments are blue.
For case (a) consider the set 7\ of the vertices at the farther ends of the 2p
or more red segments. Since the number of vertices in T\ is greater than or
equal to n(k — 1, m), there is either a red interconnected set Si with k — 1
vertices or a blue interconnected set 62 with m vertices. In the first situation,
the set {Si + vertex a} is a red interconnected k vertex set. Thus the theorem
is true for case (a).
Likewise, a similar argument holds for case (b).
Case (c) cannot hold for each vertex of the chromatic graph. For if it did
hold, then there would be (2p + 2q — l)(2p — 1) red ends. This calls for an
odd number of red ends, but since each segment has two ends, the number of
red ends is required to be even. Hence there must be at least one vertex where
either case (a) or case (b) holds, and the theorem is true for both these cases.
3. Special values for the two color problem. It is known that w(2, 4)
= 4 and w(3, 3) = 6. From Theorem 3 it follows that w(3, 4) < 9. This
value shows that the strict inequality sign in Corollary 1 has to be used in
some cases.
To assist in evaluating n (3, 5) consider the 13 element field with the elements
numbered from 0 to 12 inclusive and take each field element as a vertex in a
graph. The cubic residues in this field are 1, 5, 8, and 12 = — 1 (mod 13).
If the difference of two vertices is a cubic residue, color the corresponding
line segment red. If the difference is not a cubic residue, color the corresponding
line segment blue. Since 1 and — 1 are both cubic residues, the order of differencing is immaterial. In this chromatic graph there is no subset of three which
is red interconnected and no subset of five which is blue interconnected.
Hence n(3, 5) > 13.
Theorem 2 may now be used to remove the doubt as to the values n (3, 4) < 9
and «(3, 5) > 14. Since w(2, 5) = 5 and »(3, 5) < «(2, 5) + «(3, 4), one
readily obtains that w(3, 4) = 9 and w(3, 5) = 14.
It will now be shown that n(4, 4) > 17. Consider the field of 17 elements
numbered from 0 to 16 inclusive. Let each element be a vertex. If two vertices

have a numerical difference which is a quadratic residue of 17, the corresponding segment is to be colored red. Note that — 1 = 16 (mod 17), a square,
and hence the order in which the subtraction is performed makes no difference.
The other segments are to be colored blue.
Suppose that some four vertices are connected by segments of one color.
Without loss of generality, one of these vertices may be considered to be the
field element marked 0. Call the other three a, b, c. Then the six numbers
a, b, c, a — b, a — c, and b — c are either all residues or all non-residues.
Since a is not the zero element in the field, multiplication by a~l is permissible.
If one sets B = bar1 and C = ca~x, one can consider the new set of six numbers
1, By C, 1 — B, 1 — C, B — C. All of these must be quadratic residues of 17,
further none of them can be zero. But the residues of 17 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13,
15 and 16 and it is impossible for all members of the set above to be residues.
Theorem 3 may now be used to establish that w(4, 4) = 18.
On the basis of these values, an array may be set up giving the known
values n(k, m) as entries in the body of Table 1.

The authors desire to point out that deep combinatorial questions are
encountered in attempting evaluations of the minimum numbers. In this
paper proof or disproof of the possibility of a chromatic graph construction
leans heavily upon finite field theory.
4. Three or more colors. For three colors, red, green and blue, the evaluation of n (3, 3, 3) may be of interest.
THEOREM 4.

« ( 3 , 3 , 3 ) = 17.

Proof. It will be convenient to give the proof in two parts. First, one may
show that n(S, 3, 3) > 16 by use of a 2 4 = 16 element field. In such a field

the elements may be identified by the symbols 0, Xf X , • • • , X 16 = 1. To
assist in identifying cubic residues, one may factor
x16 - 1 ss (x4 - x - 1)(x11 + xs + x7 + x5 + x 3 + x2 + x + 1)

(mod 2),

and take x as a root of x — x — 1 = 0 (mod 2). Then the cubic residues of
the field elements are x3, x 3 + x2, x 3 + x, x 3 + x2 + x + 1, and 1. The field
elements are taken as vertices and a chromatic graph is constructed as follows.
If the difference of two vertex elements is a cubic residue, the corresponding
segment is colored red. If the difference of two elements belongs to the first
coset of the cubic residues in the multiplicative group of the non-zero field
elements, the segment is colored green. If the difference belongs to the second
coset, the segment is colored blue. These specifications define completely the
chromatic graph. Again one notes that —1 = 1 (mod 2), and the order of
differencing is immaterial.
Suppose now that a set of three vertices is completely interconnected by
segments of the same color. Without any loss of generality, the color may
be considered as red and the vertices may be considered as having been
numbered 0, 1 and A, where A and (1 — A) are both cubic residues. But a
comparison with the list of cubic residues above shows that this situation
cannot arise. Hence there is no set of three vertices interconnected by segments
of the same color, and w(3, 3, 3) > 16.
For the second part, it must be proved that 17 is a sufficient number.
In any chromatic graph with 3 colors and 17 vertices, select any one vertex
and call this vertex a. At least six segments terminating at a must all have
the same color. If in the subgraph consisting of a and the six farther ends
there is no triangle of the original color, then all interconnections among the
six farther ends must be of the other two colors. But this is now a case of
n(3} 3) = 6, and there is an interconnected set of three here.
Remark. This example serves also to prove that w(6, 3) > 16. One imagines
the graph to be examined by a man who is red-green color blind and hence sees
only two colors, namely blue and red-green. Supposing that there is no set
of three vertices interconnected in blue, then the existence of a set of six
interconnected in red-green would furnish a red triangle or a green triangle,
since n(3, 3) = 6.
THEOREM 5.

41 < «(3, 3, 3, 3) <

66.

Proof. The upper bound given in the theorem follows at once in the same
way as used in the proof of Theorem 4, i.e., reducing to the next lower case.
To establish a lower bound, one could consider chromatic graphs whose
cosets of fourth power residues were employed in connection with fields in
which the multiplicative group is of order 4k. This suggests the primes 41,
53, 61 and the extension field of 49 elements. Unfortunately, — 1 is not a
quartic residue for the cases 53 and 61, and the order of subtraction of vertex

elements would affect the question of what coset of residues the difference is
in, and thus lead to a non-unique coloring scheme. For the 41 element field,
the quartic residues are 1, 4, 10, 16, 18, 23, 25, 31, 37 and 40. There are no
consécutives in this list, and thus a triangle whose vertices are 0, 1, and A
cannot be interconnected by segments of the same color. Thus n (3, 3, 3, 3) > 4 1 .
The authors have not further narrowed the range on n (3, 3, 3, 3).
5. Upper and Lower Bounds for n(3r). Let tr = n(3r) = n(3y 3, . . . , 3).
The upper bounds used in Theorems 1, 4 and 5 can all be obtained by the
use of
THEOREM 6.

tr+1

<

(r +

1) (tr -

1) +

2.

This theorem is easily proved by induction; and then it is trivial to
establish, also by induction, that
/ r + i < 3 ( r + 1)!.
A somewhat sharper inequality may be obtained, however, without any
added difficulties. It has already been established that
tr<

l(rï)e] + 1,

r = 2,3,4,

where [M] means the greatest integer contained in M. Such a bound holds for
all integers r > 2, for if it did not there would be a least integer, say 5 + 1 ,
for which the relation failed to hold. By Theorem 6,
ts+1<

(s+

l)[(sï)e]

+ 2,

s>2.

But [ 0 + 1)! e] = (s + 1)[0!) e] + 1, and hence
ts+i<

[(s+l)\e]

+ 1

and the stated upper bound follows.
For h, an upper bound of 327 is thus obtained. In order to determine a
possible lower bound, one may generalize to some extent the previous
arguments for lower bounds.
Assume a chromatic graph with p vertices (where the p vertices are to be
thought of as field elements) and 5 colors. To ensure uniqueness of coloring,
one would require that — 1 be a 5th power residue. If p is odd, this means that
5 divides \{p — 1). If p is even, then —1 = 1 (mod 2) and the condition that
— 1 be a 5th power residue is trivially satisfied.
For r = 5, and restricting p to primes less than 327, one sees that 317,
313, 307, 293, 283 do not satisfy the divisibility condition and hence 311 and
281 (which do satisfy the divisibility condition) are the most likely cases.
For the field with 311 elements, 168 and 169 are both quintic residues. Thus
the argument that the triangle with vertices at 0, 1 and A cannot be interconnected by segments of the same color breaks down because of this unit
difference in the quintic residues. The authors have not made a complete
investigation of the case p — 281.

6. Relationship to Fermat's theorem and a certain trinomial congruence.
Returning to the general case for a lower bound to ^(3 r ), one requires that
— 1 be an rth power residue in a field of p elements. This requires a divisibility
condition (already stated for 5), namely that r divides \(p — 1) when p is
odd. One also requires that there be no solution of the trinomial congruence

V + xr + yr = 0
in the field. This congruence has been extensively studied by people interested
in Fermat's theorem (2; 3). Under the conditions assumed above a chromatic
graph on p vertices with r colors can be so constructed that no monochromatic
triangle appears.
Since an upper bound for n(Sr) has been established by Theorem 6, it
follows that when p > n(3r) and a chromatic graph has been constructed with
r colors on the p field elements, a monochromatic triangle must appear. For
such cases, then, the trinomial congruence is solvable.
The previous restriction that r divides \{p — 1) may be stated as r divides
p — 1 when r is odd. This may be interpreted as requiring the group of rth
residues to have r cosets (including the original group of residues as one of
its cosets). If r does not divide p — 1, then in the field being an rth power is
the same thing as being an rath power, where m is the greatest common divisor
of r and p — 1.
In view of the existence of the upper bound one obtains the result that there
are only a finite number of finite fields for which the trinomial congruence is
not solvable for given r (3).
