H13 is the Paley graph of order 13 (cyclic graph C_13(1,5)).
It is 4-regular, triangle-free, and has no 5-independent set.
This is a provable result from graph theory (Greenwood & Gleason 1955).

/-! ### Claim 1 Part 3: No vertex has degree 4

Following Krüger's argument (explained by Gemini):
If deg(v) = 4, then G_v (13 non-neighbors) must be isomorphic to H13 (4-regular).
Edge counting between N(v) (4 vertices) and G_v (13 vertices) leads to contradiction:
- Upper bound: Each vertex in G_v has degree 4 in G_v, total degree ≤ 5 in G,
  so max 1 edge to N(v) → at most 13 total edges
- Lower bound: Each vertex in N(v) has degree ≥ 4, uses 1 for v,
  needs ≥ 3 to G_v → at least 12 total edges

Case analysis:
1. If exactly 12 edges: One vertex w ∈ S has 0 edges to N(v), so deg(w) = 4.
   Then G_w (non-neighbors of w) must also be H13 (4-regular).
   But N(v) ⊆ G_w, and vertices in N(v) lose edges when restricted to G_w,
   breaking the regularity. Contradiction.

2. If exactly 13 edges: Degrees in N(v) sum to 4 + 13 = 17.
   Only partition of 17 into 4 parts (≥ 4 each): {4,4,4,5}.
   Pick u ∈ N(v) with deg(u) = 4. Then G_u must be H13 (4-regular).
   Pick another z ∈ N(v) with deg(z) = 4. Then z ∈ G_u (since N(v) independent).
   But z is connected to v in G, and v ∈ N(u), so in G_u, z loses edge to v.
   Thus deg_{G_u}(z) = 3, contradicting G_u being 4-regular.

/-! ### Claim 2: Neighbor structure partition

In a 5-regular triangle-free graph on 18 vertices with no 6-independent set,
the non-neighbors of any vertex v partition into sets P (4 vertices sharing 1 common
neighbor with v) and Q (8 vertices sharing 2 common neighbors with v).

This follows from double-counting: each of v's 5 neighbors has degree 5, uses 1 edge
to v, and has 4 remaining edges. Triangle-freeness means N(v) is independent, so these
20 total edges must go to the 12 non-neighbors of v. Solving P + Q = 12 and P + 2Q = 20
gives P = 4, Q = 8.
