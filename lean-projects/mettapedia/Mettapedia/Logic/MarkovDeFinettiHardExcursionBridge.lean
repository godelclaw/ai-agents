/-! LLM primer:
- Traj k N = Fin (N+1) → Fin k
- Parameterized by (a, L1, L2) where b = a + L1, c = a + L1 + L2
- segmentSwap uses dependent `if h :` so branch conditions are available to omega
- swapRemap uses < boundaries matching transition index semantics

the segment [a, a+L2] of the swapped trajectory reproduces the values of
the original segment [a+L1, a+L1+L2], and vice versa. -/
