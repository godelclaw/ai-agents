# Evidence ↔ SimpleTruthValue Bijection

This file formalizes the precise relationship between PLN's 2D evidence counts
and 1D representations (strength, confidence, valuations).

## Main Results

1. **Non-unique strength preimages**: Multiple evidence values map to the same strength
2. **Infinite fiber**: The preimage of any strength value is infinite
3. **Valuation information loss**: Any valuation destroys the partial order structure

## The Story

```
Evidence (n⁺, n⁻)  ←——bijection——→  (strength s, confidence c)
         ↓                                    ↓
         ↓  loses confidence                  ↓  loses confidence
         ↓                                    ↓
    strength alone  ←———————————→  preimage is infinite
```

When you project to strength alone, you lose the "how much evidence" information.

/-! ## Part 3: Summary Theorem -/

/-- **Main Information Hierarchy Theorem**

    Evidence (n⁺, n⁻) contains strictly more information than strength alone.

    Specifically:
    1. Strength alone has non-unique preimages
    2. Any valuation destroys the partial order structure
    3. But (strength, confidence) together recover Evidence (see toSTV/ofSTV in PLNEvidence) -/
