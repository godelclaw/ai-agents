# Solomonoff Induction Restricted to Exchangeable Domains

This file formalizes the **predictor-level** collapse behind νPLN:
Solomonoff-style prediction restricted to an **exchangeable binary** domain factors through
the sufficient statistic `(n⁺, n⁻)` (counts of `true`/`false`).

## The Key Insight

Solomonoff's universal prior M(x) assigns probability to all computable sequences.
When restricted to **exchangeable binary** sequences:

1. Exchangeability implies probabilities depend only on counts (combinatorics).
2. Therefore the Solomonoff-style predictor `μ(x++[b]) / μ(x)` depends only on `(n⁺, n⁻)`.
3. Evidence accumulation is just `hplus` on evidence counts.

We **do not** need the full measure-theoretic de Finetti representation for νPLN's core claim:
PLN uses predictors and sufficient statistics, and these make sense for semimeasures.

## Domain Characterization

**Theorem (predictor form)**: For the class of exchangeable binary environments, Solomonoff
prediction collapses from “arbitrary program mixture state” to just `(n⁺, n⁻)` (Evidence).
Additional assumptions (e.g. a Beta prior / de Finetti mixture) are only needed to identify
the *closed form* of the predictor, not the collapse itself.

/-! ### Basic Consequence: Dependence Only on Counts

The key structural consequence we use from exchangeability is count-invariance: two length-`n`
bitstrings with the same number of `true`s get the same weight.

This is the semimeasure analogue of `Exchangeability.exchangeable_same_counts_same_prob` and is the
exact statement needed for the "sufficient statistics = (n⁺, n⁻)" story at the Solomonoff level.
