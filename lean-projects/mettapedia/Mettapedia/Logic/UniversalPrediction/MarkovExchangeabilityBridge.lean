# Markov Exchangeability Bridge (Domain Test ⇒ Transition-Count Evidence)

This file connects the “domain restriction” notion of **Markov exchangeability** (probabilities
depend only on the initial state and the transition-count matrix) to the concrete
`MarkovDirichletPredictor` infrastructure:

* `Mettapedia.Logic.MarkovExchangeability.evidenceOf` defines the canonical Markov evidence on
  `Fin (n+1) → α` trajectories.
* `Mettapedia.Logic.UniversalPrediction.TransCounts.summary` computes the same transition-count
  evidence for finite words `List (Fin k)` and supports the “append bumps exactly one cell” update
  needed for Markov-Dirichlet predictors.

The main theorem in this file is a “domain test” statement:

> If a prefix-measure environment is Markov-exchangeable, then its 1-step predictions factor
> through the transition-count evidence state (counts + last symbol), as computed by `summary`.

This is the analogue of the i.i.d. “exchangeable ⇒ depends only on counts” theorem used for νPLN,
but for the next tractable restriction (Markov exchangeability).
