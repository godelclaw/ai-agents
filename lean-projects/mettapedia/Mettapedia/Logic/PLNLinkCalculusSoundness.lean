# PLN Link Calculus: Measure-Theoretic Soundness (Deduction)

This file provides a *first* soundness lemma for the weight-first PLN link calculus:

- A semantic interpretation sends formulas to measurable events in a probability space.
- Term judgments `term A t` assert `t.strength = P(A)`.
- Link judgments `link A B t` assert `t.strength = P(B|A)`.

We prove local soundness for the **deduction** truth function by reusing the existing
measure-theoretic theorem `pln_deduction_from_total_probability_ctx` from
`Mettapedia/Logic/PLNDerivation.lean`.

We intentionally do **not** claim anything about weights here: weight/evidence soundness is a
separate meta-level story.

These are definitional compositions of Bayes inversion + the deduction formula.

We reuse the same measure-theoretic deduction theorem and add a small Bayes algebra
step to rewrite the missing conditional probability.
