# MeTTaCore Bindings

Variable bindings for the MeTTa interpreter, following the Hyperon Experimental
specification. Bindings track variable-to-value assignments and variable equalities.

## Main Definitions

* `Bindings` - Variable bindings structure
* `Bindings.resolve` - Resolve a variable to its bound value
* `Bindings.apply` - Apply bindings to an atom
* `Bindings.merge` - Merge two binding sets

## References

* [Hyperon Experimental Spec](https://trueagi-io.github.io/hyperon-experimental/metta/)

/-! ## Bindings Structure -/

/-- Variable bindings: maps variable names to atoms.

    In the Hyperon spec, bindings track:
    - Variable assignments: `$x <- value`
    - Variable equalities: `$a = $b` (unified variables)

    For simplicity, we model equalities by transitively resolving to values. -/
structure Bindings where
  /-- Map from variable names to their bound values -/
  map : String → Option Atom
  deriving Inhabited

namespace Bindings

/-! ### Basic Operations -/

/-- Empty bindings -/
def empty : Bindings := ⟨fun _ => none⟩

instance : EmptyCollection Bindings := ⟨empty⟩

/-- Create bindings with a single variable assignment -/
def single (v : String) (a : Atom) : Bindings :=
  ⟨fun x => if x == v then some a else none⟩

/-- Lookup a variable in bindings -/
def lookup (b : Bindings) (v : String) : Option Atom :=
  b.map v

/-- Check if a variable is bound -/
def isBound (b : Bindings) (v : String) : Bool :=
  b.map v |>.isSome

-- Note: Get all bound variable names would require finite representation.
-- In practice, we'd use a finite map. For now, this is specification-level.

/-! ### Transitive Resolution -/

/-- Resolve a variable to its final value, following chains of variable bindings.

    If `$x` is bound to `$y` and `$y` is bound to `42`, then `resolve "x"` returns `42`.
    Uses fuel to handle potential cycles (which shouldn't exist in well-formed bindings). -/
def resolve (b : Bindings) (v : String) (fuel : Nat := 100) : Option Atom :=
  match fuel with
  | 0 => none  -- Potential cycle detected
  | n + 1 =>
    match b.map v with
    | none => none
    | some (.var w) => b.resolve w n  -- Follow variable chain
    | some a => some a

/-- Check if bindings have no cycles (well-formed) -/
def wellFormed (b : Bindings) : Prop :=
  ∀ v, b.isBound v → ∃ a, ¬a.isVariable ∧ b.resolve v 100 = some a

/-! ### Applying Bindings -/

/-- Apply bindings to an atom, replacing variables with their bound values. -/
partial def apply (b : Bindings) (a : Atom) : Atom :=
  match a with
  | .symbol s => .symbol s
  | .var v =>
    match b.resolve v with
    | some val => val
    | none => .var v  -- Keep unbound variable
  | .grounded g => .grounded g
  | .expression es => .expression (es.map (b.apply ·))

/-! ### Merging Bindings -/

/-- Result of merging two binding sets -/
inductive MergeResult where
  | success : Bindings → MergeResult
  | conflict : String → Atom → Atom → MergeResult  -- Variable, value1, value2

/-- Merge two binding sets.

    Merging fails if both bind the same variable to different (non-unifiable) values. -/
def merge (b1 b2 : Bindings) : MergeResult :=
  -- For specification, we assume consistent bindings
  -- A full implementation would check for conflicts
  .success ⟨fun v =>
    match b1.map v, b2.map v with
    | some a, none => some a
    | none, some a => some a
    | some a1, some a2 =>
        if a1 == a2 then some a1 else some a1  -- Simplified: take first on conflict
    | none, none => none
  ⟩

/-- Merge, returning none on conflict -/
def mergeOpt (b1 b2 : Bindings) : Option Bindings :=
  match merge b1 b2 with
  | .success b => some b
  | .conflict _ _ _ => none

/-! ### Extension -/

/-- Extend bindings with a new assignment -/
def extend (b : Bindings) (v : String) (a : Atom) : Bindings :=
  ⟨fun x => if x == v then some a else b.map x⟩

/-- Extend bindings with multiple assignments -/
def extendMany (b : Bindings) (assignments : List (String × Atom)) : Bindings :=
  assignments.foldl (fun acc (v, a) => acc.extend v a) b

/-! ### Equality -/

/-- Bindings equality (on a finite set of variables) -/
def eqOn (b1 b2 : Bindings) (vars : List String) : Bool :=
  vars.all fun v => b1.map v == b2.map v

end Bindings

/-! ## Theorems -/

/-- Empty bindings don't resolve any variable -/
theorem empty_resolve (v : String) (fuel : Nat) :
    Bindings.empty.resolve v fuel = none := by
  cases fuel <;> simp [Bindings.resolve, Bindings.empty]

/-- Single binding resolves correctly for non-variable atoms -/
theorem single_resolve_nonvar (v : String) (a : Atom) (fuel : Nat) (hfuel : fuel > 0) :
    ¬a.isVariable →
    (Bindings.single v a).resolve v fuel = some a := by
  intro hnotvar
  cases fuel with
  | zero => omega
  | succ n =>
    simp only [Bindings.resolve, Bindings.single]
    simp only [beq_self_eq_true, ↓reduceIte]
    cases a with
    | symbol _ => rfl
    | var _ => simp [Atom.isVariable] at hnotvar
    | grounded _ => rfl
    | expression _ => rfl

/-- Single binding lookup is correct -/
theorem single_lookup (v : String) (a : Atom) :
    (Bindings.single v a).lookup v = some a := by
  simp [Bindings.lookup, Bindings.single]

/-- Empty bindings lookup returns none -/
theorem empty_lookup (v : String) :
    Bindings.empty.lookup v = none := by
  simp [Bindings.lookup, Bindings.empty]

-- Empty bindings
example : Bindings.empty.lookup "x" = none := rfl

-- Extension
example : (Bindings.empty.extend "x" (.symbol "a")).lookup "x" = some (.symbol "a") := rfl

-- Apply to variable (partial function, so not rfl - use native_decide)
example : (Bindings.single "x" (.symbol "a")).apply (.var "x") = .symbol "a" := by native_decide
example : Bindings.empty.apply (.var "x") = .var "x" := by native_decide

-- Apply to expression (partial function)
example : (Bindings.single "x" (.grounded (.int 1))).apply
            (.expression [.symbol "+", .var "x", .grounded (.int 2)]) =
