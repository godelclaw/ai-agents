# Billingsley Chapter 1, Section 3: Existence and Extension

This file formalizes Section 3 of Billingsley's "Probability and Measure" (3rd Edition),
which covers the extension of probability measures from a field to a σ-field.

## Main results

* The Carathéodory extension theorem (Theorem 3.1)
* Uniqueness of measure extension (Theorem 3.3)
* The π-λ theorem

## Notes

The Carathéodory construction is implemented in mathlib via `MeasureTheory.OuterMeasure`.
We present the key results following Billingsley's exposition.

/-! ## Outer Measure

The outer measure P*(A) is defined as the infimum of Σ P(Aₙ) over all
coverings of A by sets from the field F₀.

/-- P* is monotone -/

    μ A ≤ μ B := μ.mono h

/-- P* is countably subadditive -/

/-! ## The Extension Theorem

Theorem 3.1 (Carathéodory): A probability measure on a field has a unique
extension to the generated σ-field.

Note: The hypothesis requires P to be *countably* additive on the field F₀
(Billingsley p.37: "the set function P on it must be assumed countably additive").
Finite additivity alone is not sufficient for the extension to work.

/-- Billingsley's Theorem 3.1: Existence of measure extension.
Given a countably additive probability measure P on a field F₀, there exists
a measure Q on σ(F₀) that agrees with P on F₀.

In mathlib, this is handled by the Carathéodory extension via `AddContent.measure`.
The key hypotheses are:
1. F₀ is a field (closed under complement and finite union)
2. P is countably additive on F₀ (not just finitely additive)
3. P(Ω) = 1 (probability measure) -/
