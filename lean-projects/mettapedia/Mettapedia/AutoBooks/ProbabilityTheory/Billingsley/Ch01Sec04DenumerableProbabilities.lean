# Billingsley Chapter 1, Section 4: Denumerable Probabilities

This file formalizes Section 4 of Billingsley's "Probability and Measure" (3rd Edition),
which covers probability concepts for infinite sequences of events.

## Main concepts

* Conditional probability
* Chain rule
* Limit sets (limsup, liminf)
* Independence of events
* Borel-Cantelli lemmas

## Notes

Many results in this section are already in mathlib:
- `MeasureTheory.Measure.cond` for conditional probability
- `Filter.limsup` and `Filter.liminf` for limit sets
- `ProbabilityTheory.iIndepSet` for independence
- `MeasureTheory.measure_limsup_atTop_eq_zero` for first Borel-Cantelli
- `ProbabilityTheory.measure_limsup_eq_one` for second Borel-Cantelli

We present the results following Billingsley's exposition for pedagogical clarity.

/-! ## Conditional Probability

Formula (4.1): P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A) for P(A) > 0.

In mathlib, conditional probability is defined via `ProbabilityTheory.cond`.
-/

/-- Billingsley's conditional probability formula (4.1).
In mathlib, `μ[B|A] = (μ A)⁻¹ * μ (A ∩ B)`.
See `ProbabilityTheory.cond_apply` for the mathlib statement. -/
theorem condProb_eq_inter_div (A B : Set Ω) (hA_meas : MeasurableSet A) :
    μ[B|A] = (μ A)⁻¹ * μ (A ∩ B) :=
  cond_apply hA_meas μ B

/-! ## Limit Sets

Definitions (4.4) and (4.5):
- lim sup Aₙ = ⋂ₙ ⋃_{k≥n} Aₖ (ω lies in infinitely many Aₙ)
- lim inf Aₙ = ⋃ₙ ⋂_{k≥n} Aₖ (ω lies in all but finitely many Aₙ)

These are `Filter.limsup` and `Filter.liminf` in mathlib.
-/

/-- ω lies in lim sup Aₙ iff ω lies in infinitely many Aₙ.
This is Billingsley's characterization of (4.4). -/
theorem mem_limsup_iff_frequently (A : ℕ → Set Ω) (ω : Ω) :
    ω ∈ Filter.limsup A atTop ↔ ∃ᶠ n in atTop, ω ∈ A n :=
  Filter.mem_limsup_iff_frequently_mem

/-- ω lies in lim inf Aₙ iff ω lies in all but finitely many Aₙ.
This is Billingsley's characterization of (4.5). -/
theorem mem_liminf_iff_eventually (A : ℕ → Set Ω) (ω : Ω) :
    ω ∈ Filter.liminf A atTop ↔ ∀ᶠ n in atTop, ω ∈ A n :=
  Filter.mem_liminf_iff_eventually_mem

/-- lim inf ⊆ lim sup always holds.
Billingsley notes: if ω lies in all but finitely many Aₙ,
then of course it lies in infinitely many of them. -/
theorem liminf_subset_limsup (A : ℕ → Set Ω) :
    Filter.liminf A atTop ⊆ Filter.limsup A atTop :=
  Filter.liminf_le_limsup

/-- Countable union of null sets is null (Billingsley p.52).

/-! ## Independence

Two events A, B are independent if P(A ∩ B) = P(A) · P(B).

In mathlib, this is handled by `ProbabilityTheory.IndepSet`.
-/

/-- Two events are independent if P(A ∩ B) = P(A) · P(B).
This is Billingsley's definition following (4.8). -/
def AreIndependent (A B : Set Ω) : Prop :=
  μ (A ∩ B) = μ A * μ B

/-- Independence is symmetric. -/
theorem AreIndependent.symm {A B : Set Ω} (h : AreIndependent μ A B) :
    AreIndependent μ B A := by
  unfold AreIndependent at *
  rw [Set.inter_comm, mul_comm]
  exact h

/-- If A and B are independent, then so are A and Bᶜ.
This is Billingsley's remark below (4.8).

The proof uses: μ(A ∩ Bᶜ) = μ(A) - μ(A ∩ B) = μ(A) - μ(A)μ(B) = μ(A)(1 - μ(B)) = μ(A)μ(Bᶜ).

/-! ## Borel-Cantelli Lemmas -/

/-- First Borel-Cantelli Lemma (Billingsley Theorem 4.3):
If Σₙ P(Aₙ) < ∞, then P(lim sup Aₙ) = 0.

In other words: if the sum of probabilities is finite, then almost surely
only finitely many of the events occur.

This is `MeasureTheory.measure_limsup_atTop_eq_zero` in mathlib. -/
theorem first_borel_cantelli {A : ℕ → Set Ω}
    (hA_summable : ∑' n, μ (A n) ≠ ⊤) :
    μ (Filter.limsup A atTop) = 0 :=
  measure_limsup_atTop_eq_zero hA_summable

/-- Second Borel-Cantelli Lemma (Billingsley Theorem 4.4):
If the Aₙ are independent and Σₙ P(Aₙ) = ∞, then P(lim sup Aₙ) = 1.

In other words: if the events are independent and the sum of probabilities
diverges, then almost surely infinitely many of the events occur.

This is `ProbabilityTheory.measure_limsup_eq_one` in mathlib. -/
theorem second_borel_cantelli {A : ℕ → Set Ω}
    (hA_meas : ∀ n, MeasurableSet (A n))
    (hA_indep : iIndepSet A μ)
    (hA_diverge : ∑' n, μ (A n) = ⊤) :
    μ (Filter.limsup A atTop) = 1 :=
  measure_limsup_eq_one hA_meas hA_indep hA_diverge

/-! ## Example 4.1: Run lengths in binary expansion

Example 4.1 concerns the run lengths lₙ(ω) of 0's starting at position n
in the dyadic expansion. This uses the machinery from Section 1 and is
developed there via `dyadicDigit`.

Key results:
- P[lₙ(ω) ≥ r] = 2⁻ʳ (formula 4.7)
- Application of Borel-Cantelli to run lengths

/-! ## Zero-One Law

Kolmogorov's Zero-One Law states that any event in the tail σ-algebra
has probability 0 or 1. This will be developed in Section 22 where
the tail σ-algebra is properly defined.
