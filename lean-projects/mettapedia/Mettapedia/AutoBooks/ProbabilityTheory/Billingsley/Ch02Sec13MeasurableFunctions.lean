# Billingsley Chapter 2, Section 13: Measurable Functions and Mappings

This file formalizes Section 13 of Billingsley's "Probability and Measure" (3rd Edition).
A measurable mapping between measurable spaces is a mapping whose preimage of any
measurable set is measurable — this is `Measurable` in mathlib.

## Scope

* Definition of measurable mapping `T : (Ω, 𝓕) → (Ω', 𝓕')`.
* **Theorem 13.1**: generator-level measurability; composition of measurable maps.
* **Theorem 13.2**: continuous mappings between topological spaces (with Borel σ-fields)
  are measurable.
* **Theorem 13.3**: pushforward by a continuous (or measurable) `g : ℝ^k → ℝ^l`.
* **Theorem 13.4**: measurability of `sup`, `inf`, `limsup`, `liminf`, pointwise limits.
* **Theorem 13.5**: every nonnegative measurable function is a pointwise limit of an
  increasing sequence of simple functions.
* Simple-function representation (Billingsley (13.3)).

/-! ## Definition: measurable mapping -/

/-- A mapping `T : Ω → Ω'` is measurable `𝓕/𝓕'` iff the preimage of every `𝓕'`-measurable
set is `𝓕`-measurable. This is mathlib's `Measurable`. -/
example (T : Ω → Ω') : Prop := Measurable T

/-! ## Theorem 13.1: generator-level measurability; composition -/

/-- **Theorem 13.1 (i)**: if `T⁻¹ A' ∈ 𝓕` for each `A'` in a generating class of `𝓕'`,
then `T` is measurable. -/

measurable components is measurable. -/

functions is measurable. -/

/-- **Theorem 13.4 (ii)**: the pointwise limit (when it exists everywhere) of a sequence
of measurable functions is measurable. We state this via `limsup`. -/
theorem measurable_limsup {f : ℕ → Ω → ℝ} (hf : ∀ n, Measurable (f n)) :

/-! ## Simple functions (Billingsley (13.3), Theorem 13.5) -/

/-- Simple real functions: a finite linear combination of characteristic functions of a
measurable partition. In mathlib this is `MeasureTheory.SimpleFunc`. -/
example (Ω : Type*) [MeasurableSpace Ω] : Type := MeasureTheory.SimpleFunc Ω ℝ

/-- **Theorem 13.5** (Billingsley): for every measurable `f : Ω → [0, ∞)` there is a
nondecreasing sequence of measurable simple functions converging pointwise to `f`. -/
