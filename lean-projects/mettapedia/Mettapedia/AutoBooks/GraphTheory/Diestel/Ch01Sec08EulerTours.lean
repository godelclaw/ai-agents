# Diestel, Graph Theory — Section 1.8: Euler Tours

Formalization of definitions and results from Section 1.8 of:
  R. Diestel, *Graph Theory* (5th edition), Springer GTM 173.

We build on Mathlib's `Walk.IsEulerian` infrastructure from
`Mathlib.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph.Trails`.

/-! ### Diestel §1.8 — Definitions (pointers to Mathlib)

| Diestel            | Mathlib                                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Euler tour         | `Walk.IsEulerian` + `Walk.IsCircuit`        |
| Eulerian graph     | `∃ (v) (p : Walk v v), p.IsEulerian ∧ p.IsCircuit` |

Mathlib defines `Walk.IsEulerian p` as: every edge of `G.edgeSet`
appears exactly once in `p.edges`.  An Eulerian *circuit* is additionally
a circuit (`IsCircuit`), i.e., a closed trail with `length ≥ 1`.

/-- A graph is **Eulerian** if it admits a closed walk that traverses
    every edge exactly once (an Euler tour in Diestel's terminology). -/

/-! ### Theorem 1.8.1 (Diestel §1.8, p. 22)

> "A connected graph is Eulerian if and only if every vertex has even degree."
-/

/-- **Theorem 1.8.1, necessity** (Diestel §1.8):
    An Eulerian graph has all even degrees.

    Follows from Mathlib's `Walk.IsEulerian.even_degree_iff`:
    for a closed Eulerian walk (u = v), every vertex has even degree. -/
theorem IsEulerian.all_even_degree (h : IsEulerian G) :
    ∀ v : V, Even (G.degree v) := by
  obtain ⟨u, p, hE, hC⟩ := h
  intro x
  rw [hE.even_degree_iff]
  intro hne; exact absurd rfl hne

/-! ### Sufficiency: connected + all even degrees + nonempty edges → Eulerian

The maximal-trail approach: the longest closed trail in a connected
graph with all even degrees must use every edge.

Note: for a graph with no edges (single vertex), the theorem requires
non-empty edge set, because our `IsEulerian` demands a non-nil circuit. -/

/-- A maximal trail (among all trails in G) in a graph with all even
    degrees is closed.  Proof: if a trail ends at u ≠ v, then the
    parity argument shows u has at least one unused incident edge,
    so we can extend the trail by one step — contradicting maximality. -/

/-- **Theorem 1.8.1, sufficiency** (Diestel §1.8):
    A connected graph with nonempty edge set in which every vertex
    has even degree is Eulerian.

    Proof: the maximal trail is closed (by parity) and covers all edges
    (by connectivity: if some edge is missed, splicing a sub-trail at
    a shared vertex produces a longer trail, contradicting maximality). -/
