/-- A graph G is **k-vertex-connected** if |V| > k and G remains
    (pre)connected after removing any set of fewer than k vertices.

    Diestel §1.4: "A graph G = (V, E) is called k-connected (for k ∈ ℕ)
    if |G| > k and G − X is connected for every set X ⊆ V with |X| < k."

    We use `Preconnected` (no `Nonempty` requirement) since the cardinality
    bound `k < |V|` already guarantees the complement of any small set is
    nonempty. -/
def IsKVertexConnected (k : ℕ) : Prop :=
  k < Fintype.card V ∧ ∀ (S : Finset V), S.card < k →
    (G.induce ((↑S : Set V)ᶜ)).Preconnected

/-- Every graph with ≥ 1 vertex is 0-vertex-connected (vacuously: no set
    has cardinality < 0). -/
theorem isKVertexConnected_zero (h : 0 < Fintype.card V) :
    IsKVertexConnected G 0 :=
  ⟨h, fun _ hS => absurd hS (by omega)⟩

/-- k-vertex-connected implies minimum degree ≥ k.

    Proof: if deg(v) < k, then |N(v)| < k. By k-vertex-connectivity,
    G − N(v) is preconnected. But v ∈ (N(v))ᶜ (no self-loops) and v is
    isolated in G − N(v). Since |(N(v))ᶜ| ≥ |V| − k + 1 ≥ 2, there
    exists u ≠ v in (N(v))ᶜ. Preconnectedness gives a walk v→u, but v
    is isolated, so the walk is nil, forcing v = u. Contradiction. -/

/-- **Proposition 1.4.2, second inequality** (Diestel §1.4):
    Edge-connectivity does not exceed minimum degree.

    Predicate form: if `G` is `(δ(G) + 1)`-edge-connected and non-trivial,
    we get a contradiction.  Proof idea: the δ(G) edges incident to a
    minimum-degree vertex form an edge cut of size δ(G). -/

/-- **Proposition 1.4.2, first inequality** (Diestel §1.4):
    If G is k-vertex-connected then G is k-edge-connected.

    PROOF SKETCH:
    Given edge set F with |F| < k and vertices u, v:
    1. Pick one endpoint from each edge in F (avoiding u and v when possible)
       to form vertex set S with |S| ≤ |F| < k.
    2. By k-vertex-connectivity, G - S is preconnected.
    3. Case {u,v} ∉ F: both u,v ∈ G-S. Path in G-S avoids all edges of F
       (each edge has an endpoint in S). Transfer to G.deleteEdges F.
    4. Case {u,v} ∈ F: must place one of u,v in S. Key counting:
       each edge blocks at most one neighbor of v (either via S membership
       or via deleted edge), so |blocked| ≤ |F| < k ≤ deg(v).
       Thus ∃ w ∈ N(v) with w ∉ S and {v,w} ∉ F.
       Path: u →(in G-S)→ w →(edge in G.deleteEdges F)→ v. -/
