# Joint Actions and Percepts for Multi-Agent RL

This file defines the basic structures for multi-agent reinforcement learning:
joint actions, joint percepts, and multi-agent histories.

## Main Definitions

* `JointAction n`: A tuple of n actions (one per agent)
* `JointPercept n`: A tuple of n percepts (one per agent)
* `MultiAgentHistory n`: Interleaved sequence of joint actions and joint percepts
* `playerView i`: Extract agent i's single-agent history from multi-agent history

## Key Design Decision

We use `Fin n → Action` rather than `Vector Action n` because:
1. Simpler reasoning (function application vs vector indexing)
2. Better compatibility with Mathlib's Fintype machinery
3. Easier to prove properties about "for all agents"

/-! ## Joint Actions -/

/-- A joint action is a function assigning an action to each of n agents.

    For n=2 agents, a joint action might be:
    - Agent 0 chooses Action.left
    - Agent 1 chooses Action.right

    We represent this as a function `Fin 2 → Action` rather than a tuple
    for easier reasoning about properties that hold "for all agents".

def JointAction (n : ℕ) : Type := Fin n → Action

/-- Extract agent i's action from a joint action. -/
def JointAction.get {n : ℕ} (ja : JointAction n) (i : Fin n) : Action := ja i

/-- Construct a joint action from individual actions.

    This is just the identity function, but we define it for clarity. -/
def JointAction.mk {n : ℕ} (f : Fin n → Action) : JointAction n := f

/-- Two joint actions are equal if all agents choose the same actions. -/

    (∀ i : Fin n, ja₁ i = ja₂ i) → ja₁ = ja₂ := by

/-- Joint actions are finite when Action is finite. -/

/-- The number of possible joint actions is |Action|^n. -/
theorem JointAction.card {n : ℕ} :
    Fintype.card (JointAction n) = (Fintype.card Action) ^ n := by
  simp [JointAction]

/-! ## Joint Percepts -/

/-- A joint percept is a function assigning a percept to each of n agents.

    In multi-agent settings, each agent may observe different information.
    For example, in a card game:
    - Agent 0 sees their own cards + public cards
    - Agent 1 sees their own cards + public cards (different from Agent 0)

  simp [JointPercept]

/-! ## Joint History Elements -/

/-- A joint history element is either a joint action or a joint percept.

    Multi-agent histories are sequences of joint actions and joint percepts:
    ⟨ja₀, jp₀, ja₁, jp₁, ja₂, jp₂, ...⟩

    This is analogous to single-agent HistElem but for multiple agents. -/
inductive JointHistElem (n : ℕ) : Type
  | act : JointAction n → JointHistElem n
  | per : JointPercept n → JointHistElem n

/-- Extract agent i's view of a joint history element. -/
def JointHistElem.playerView {n : ℕ} (jhe : JointHistElem n) (i : Fin n) : HistElem :=
  match jhe with
  | JointHistElem.act ja => HistElem.act (ja i)
  | JointHistElem.per jp => HistElem.per (jp i)

/-! ## Multi-Agent History -/

/-- A multi-agent history is a list of joint history elements.

    Like single-agent History, but each element contains actions/percepts
    for ALL agents simultaneously.

    Example for 2 agents, 3 timesteps:
    [act ⟨a₀₀, a₁₀⟩, per ⟨p₀₀, p₁₀⟩,
     act ⟨a₀₁, a₁₁⟩, per ⟨p₀₁, p₁₁⟩,
     act ⟨a₀₂, a₁₂⟩, per ⟨p₀₂, p₁₂⟩]
-/

namespace MultiAgentHistory

/-- The empty multi-agent history. -/
def empty {n : ℕ} : MultiAgentHistory n := []

/-- Check if a multi-agent history is well-formed.

    A history is well-formed if actions and percepts alternate properly.
    Valid histories: [], [act], [act, per], [act, per, act], [act, per, act, per], ...

    This mirrors the single-agent definition which allows ending with an action
    (needed for environment probability queries after an action is taken). -/
def wellFormed {n : ℕ} (h : MultiAgentHistory n) : Bool :=
  match h with
  | [] => true
  | [JointHistElem.act _] => true  -- Can end with action (like single-agent)
  | JointHistElem.act _ :: JointHistElem.per _ :: rest => wellFormed rest
  | _ => false

/-- The number of complete action-percept cycles in the history. -/
def cycles {n : ℕ} (h : MultiAgentHistory n) : ℕ :=
  h.length / 2

/-- Extract the list of joint actions from a history. -/
def jointActions {n : ℕ} : MultiAgentHistory n → List (JointAction n)
  | [] => []
  | JointHistElem.act ja :: rest => ja :: jointActions rest
  | JointHistElem.per _ :: rest => jointActions rest

/-- Extract the list of joint percepts from a history. -/
def jointPercepts {n : ℕ} : MultiAgentHistory n → List (JointPercept n)
  | [] => []
  | JointHistElem.act _ :: rest => jointPercepts rest
  | JointHistElem.per jp :: rest => jp :: jointPercepts rest

/-! NOTE: Well-formed histories have equal numbers of actions and percepts

This property (`wellFormed h → jointActions h.length = jointPercepts h.length`)
is straightforward to prove by induction on the `wellFormed` structure.

Proof sketch: Observe that each valid step in a well-formed history adds
exactly one action and one percept, maintaining the balance.

Will be proven when needed (estimated ~10 lines).

/-- Extract agent i's single-agent history from a multi-agent history.

    This is the KEY function connecting multi-agent and single-agent frameworks.
    Agent i "sees" only their own actions and percepts, not others'. -/
def playerView {n : ℕ} (i : Fin n) (h : MultiAgentHistory n) : History :=
  h.map (fun jhe => jhe.playerView i)

/-- Player view of a well-formed multi-agent history is well-formed.

    The `map` function preserves the alternating action/percept structure
    because `jhe.playerView i` maps actions to actions and percepts to percepts.

    Multi-agent wellFormed accepts: [], [act], [act,per], [act,per,act], ...
    Single-agent wellFormed accepts: [], [act], [act,per], [act,per,act], ...
    These are identical, so the implication is direct.
