/-! ## Two-Player Prisoner's Dilemma

Standard prisoner's dilemma payoff matrix:
          | Cooperate | Defect  |
----------|-----------|---------|
Cooperate |   (3,3)   |  (0,5)  |
Defect    |   (5,0)   |  (1,1)  |

The unique Nash equilibrium is (Defect, Defect) with payoff (1,1).

    We map to the existing Action type: left = cooperate, right = defect. -/

  | Action.right, Action.left  => 5  -- I defect, they cooperate
  | Action.right, Action.right => 1  -- Both defect

Payoff matrix:
     | A   | B   |
-----|-----|-----|
  A  | 2,2 | 0,0 |
  B  | 0,0 | 1,1 |

Two pure Nash equilibria: (A,A) and (B,B).

/-! ## Matching Pennies (Zero-Sum)

Payoff matrix (row player):
      | Heads | Tails |
------|-------|-------|
Heads |   1   |  -1   |
Tails |  -1   |   1   |

This is a zero-sum game: payoffs sum to 0.
No pure strategy Nash equilibrium exists.

    Col's payoff is the negative of row's (zero-sum). -/

/-! ## General Properties -/

/-- In zero-sum games, if one player gains, the other loses equally.
    This is the defining property of zero-sum games. -/
theorem zero_sum_transfer (payoff : Action → Action → Int)
    (h_zero_sum : ∀ a b, payoff a b + payoff b a = 0)
    (a₁ a₂ b₁ b₂ : Action) :
    payoff a₁ b₁ - payoff a₂ b₂ = -(payoff b₁ a₁ - payoff b₂ a₂) := by
  have h1 := h_zero_sum a₁ b₁
  have h2 := h_zero_sum a₂ b₂
  omega

/-- The social welfare (sum of payoffs) in PD is maximized by mutual cooperation.
    This illustrates the "dilemma": individually rational behavior leads to
    collectively suboptimal outcomes. -/
theorem pd_social_welfare_comparison :
    -- Mutual cooperation welfare > Mutual defection welfare
    pdPayoff1 pdCooperate pdCooperate + pdPayoff2 pdCooperate pdCooperate >
    pdPayoff1 pdDefect pdDefect + pdPayoff2 pdDefect pdDefect := by
