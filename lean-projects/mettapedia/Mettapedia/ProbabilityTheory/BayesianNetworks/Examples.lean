# Classic Bayesian Network Examples

This file provides standard examples to verify the Bayesian network formalization.
We demonstrate the three fundamental structures:

1. **Chain**: A → B → C
2. **Fork**: A ← B → C (common cause)
3. **Collider**: A → C ← B (v-structure)

/-! ## Summary

This file demonstrates the fundamental BN structures - ALL PROOFS COMPLETE (0 sorries).

**Three-node networks** (all acyclicity proven ✓):
- **Chain**: A → B → C
- **Fork**: A ← B → C (common cause)
- **Collider**: A → C ← B (v-structure)

**Five-node Alarm network** (acyclicity proven ✓):
- Burglary → Alarm ← Earthquake
- Alarm → JohnCalls, Alarm → MaryCalls

**Parent set theorems** (all proven ✓):
- `chain_parents_A`, `chain_parents_B`, `chain_parents_C`
- `fork_parents_B`
- `collider_parents_C`

**D-separation examples** (all proven ✓):
- `chain_dsep_A_C_given_B` - Path A-B-C blocked when B observed (non-collider in Z)
- `collider_dsep_A_B_given_empty` - Path A-C-B blocked when C not observed (collider not in Z)
