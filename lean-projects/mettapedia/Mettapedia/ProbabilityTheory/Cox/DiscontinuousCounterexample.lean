# Cox's Theorem Requires Continuity: A Formal Counterexample

This file proves that Cox's theorem genuinely requires the continuity axiom.
Without continuity, the functional equation has pathological solutions that
are NOT equivalent to the standard product rule.

## Main Results

1. `discontinuousAdditive_exists`: There exists a discontinuous additive function ℝ → ℝ
   (classical result, Hamel 1905 - we axiomatize it)
2. `cox_underdetermined_without_continuity`: Without continuity, Cox's axioms admit
   multiple non-equivalent solutions

## Mathematical Background

Cauchy's functional equation f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) has:
- Continuous solutions: only f(x) = cx (linear)
- Discontinuous solutions: pathological functions built from Hamel bases

The discontinuous solutions are constructed by:
1. Choosing a Hamel basis H for ℝ as a ℚ-vector space (requires Choice)
2. Defining f arbitrarily on H, then extending ℚ-linearly
3. If f is not ℝ-linear on H, the extension is discontinuous

Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy's_functional_equation

## Comparison with SD Counterexample

This is analogous to our SD (semidirect product) counterexample for K&S:
- SD shows K&S basic axioms don't imply commutativity → need Separation
- Hamel functions show Cox basic axioms don't determine F uniquely → need Continuity

## Part 1: Discontinuous Additive Functions Exist

We axiomatize the classical result (Hamel, 1905) that discontinuous
additive functions exist. The full construction requires:
1. ℝ is a ℚ-vector space (Module ℚ ℝ)
2. Existence of a Hamel basis (requires Axiom of Choice)
3. Extending a non-ℝ-linear function on the basis

/-- **Axiom (Hamel, 1905)**: There exist discontinuous additive functions.

This is a classical result requiring the Axiom of Choice. The construction:
1. Let B be a Hamel basis for ℝ over ℚ (exists by Zorn's lemma)
2. B is uncountable (since dim_ℚ(ℝ) = |ℝ|)
3. Pick b₁, b₂ ∈ B with b₂/b₁ ∉ ℚ
4. Define g(b₁) = b₂, g(b₂) = b₁, g(b) = b for other basis elements
5. Extend g ℚ-linearly to f : ℝ → ℝ
6. f is additive but f(b₁)/b₁ ≠ f(b₂)/b₂, so f ≠ c·id for any c
7. By the theorem above, f is not continuous

We axiomatize this rather than construct it, as the Hamel basis construction
is complex in Mathlib and the mathematical content is well-established.

## Part 2: Cox Without Continuity is Underdetermined

If F : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ satisfies:
- Associativity: F(F(x,y), z) = F(x, F(y,z))
- Identity: F(1,y) = y, F(x,1) = x

Then F(x,y) = φ⁻¹(φ(x) + φ(y)) for some additive φ.

Without continuity, φ can be any of the uncountably many discontinuous
additive functions, giving uncountably many non-equivalent solutions.

## Part 3: The Philosophical Point

Without continuity:
- Cox's axioms have UNCOUNTABLY many solutions (one for each Hamel basis choice)
- None of these is "the" probability product rule
- Continuity is what singles out F(x,y) = x·y as the unique solution

This is analogous to how K&S's separation axiom is needed to rule out
the semidirect product counterexample SD.

| Axiom System | Without Extra Axiom | With Extra Axiom |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------|
| K&S          | SD counterexample   | Separation → ℝ₊  |
| Cox          | Hamel pathologies   | Continuity → x·y |
