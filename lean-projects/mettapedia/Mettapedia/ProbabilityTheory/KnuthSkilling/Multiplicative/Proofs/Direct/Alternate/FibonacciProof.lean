# Appendix B (Historical / Alternate): Fibonacci / Golden-Ratio Route

This module is an **alternate entry point** for the historical K&S Appendix B development in
`Mettapedia.ProbabilityTheory.KnuthSkilling.Multiplicative.Proofs.Direct.FibonacciProof`.

It is intentionally **not** imported by the main `...Multiplicative` facade, because it pulls in
substantial number-theory and Diophantine approximation dependencies that are irrelevant to the
Lean-friendly mainline proof (`...Multiplicative.StrictMonoSolution`).
