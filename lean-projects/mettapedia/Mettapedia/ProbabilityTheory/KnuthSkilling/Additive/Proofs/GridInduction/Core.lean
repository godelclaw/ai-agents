This module is a thin import shim that aggregates the full core development.

The full development lives in `...Additive/Proofs/GridInduction/Core/All.lean` and is refactored into
smaller, dependency-ordered files under:
`Mettapedia/ProbabilityTheory/KnuthSkilling/Additive/Proofs/GridInduction/Core/`.
