# Jenei (arXiv:1910.01387) — Hahn embedding for (odd involutive) residuated semigroups

This file is the “statement layer” for the representation/embedding results in:

- Sándor Jenei, *The Hahn embedding theorem for a class of residuated semigroups*
  (arXiv:1910.01387v4), local PDF:
  `literature/KS_codex/Jipsen_Tuyt_2019_Hahn_Embedding.pdf`.

Notes:
* The filename in `literature/KS_codex/` is legacy/misleading (“Jipsen_Tuyt”), but the PDF itself is
  Jenei’s paper (see its title page and abstract).
* The full construction uses *partial sublex products* (Definition 4.2, Theorem 11.1).
  Formalizing the construction and theorem proof is substantial.
* What we do here is **not** a proof; we provide precise Lean interfaces (definitions + theorem
  statements-as-`Prop`) that downstream code can depend on without `sorry`.

We also define the “add top and bottom as annihilators” extension used repeatedly in Definition 4.2.

## A `WithTopBot` extension with annihilators for `(*)`

Jenei’s Definition 4.2 repeatedly uses “add a new top element `>` as a top element and annihilator,
then add a new bottom element `⊥` as a bottom element and annihilator”.

Mathlib’s `WithTop`/`WithBot` are optimized for *additive* structures and do not provide a generic
multiplication. Here we define a dedicated extension for multiplicative monoids:

* `⊥` is an annihilator (`⊥ * x = ⊥`, `x * ⊥ = ⊥`) and is the least element.
* `⊤` is also an annihilator unless `⊥` is present (so `⊤ * ⊥ = ⊥`), and is the greatest element.
* `↑a` multiplies as `↑(a*b)`.

This matches the “add `>` then add `⊥`” order of construction: `⊥` dominates `⊤` under `(*)`.

## FLe-algebras (Definition 1.1)

Jenei’s Definition 1.1 introduces an `FLe`-algebra:

* a lattice `(X, ∧, ∨)` with order `≤`,
* a commutative, residuated monoid `(X, *, 1, ⟿)` satisfying adjointness
  `x * y ≤ z ↔ y ≤ x ⟿ z`,
* a constant `f` (used to define the residual complement `x⁰ := x ⟿ f`),
* involutive means `(x⁰)⁰ = x`,
* odd means `1 = f`.

We package these as Lean typeclasses so other files can talk about “odd involutive FLe-algebras”
without committing to a particular construction.

## Statement-only interfaces for Jenei’s main theorems

We record the theorem statements as `Prop` so the K&S development can depend on them without
introducing `sorry`. The intent is that these will be discharged either by:

* a dedicated formalization of Jenei’s partial sublex product machinery, or
* importing an existing Lean development, or
* proving that K&S implies a *stronger* ordered-group representation that subsumes these.

### Theorem 11.1 (informal)

> Every odd involutive `FLe`-chain with finitely many positive idempotents can be represented as a
> finite partial sublex product of linearly ordered abelian groups.

### Corollary 11.6 (informal)

> The monoid reduct of any odd involutive `FLe`-chain with finitely many idempotents embeds into a
> finite lexicographic product of the form `H₁ × G₂^{>⊥} × ... × Gₙ^{>⊥}`.

For Lean purposes, we record a slightly more uniform target: a lexicographic product whose factors
are all extended by `WithTopBot`. This is implied by Corollary 11.6 by composing with the obvious
inclusion `G ↪ WithTopBot G` on the first coordinate.

coordinate extended by `WithTopBot`. -/

  Lex (∀ i : Fin n, WithTopBot (G i))

This version uses `WithTopBot` for **all** coordinates for uniformity, as explained above. -/

## Theorem 11.1 (tracking)

Theorem 11.1 (“partial sublex product group representation”) is substantially stronger than
Corollary 11.6 and depends on Jenei’s Type I / Type II partial sublex product constructions
(Definition 4.2, Theorem 4.4, Definition B).

We intentionally do **not** encode it yet: doing this properly requires first formalizing the
partial sublex product constructors and their induced `FLeAlgebra` structure.

For K&S-facing work, the main reusable consequence is `JeneiCorollary11_6_Spec`.
