# The Hypercube of Probability Theories

## Overview

Different structural assumptions lead to different probability theories.
We can visualize these as vertices of a "hypercube" with axes:

1. **Logic Axis**: Boolean vs Heyting (complement behavior)
2. **Representation Axis**: Point-valued vs 2D/Bounds-valued
3. **Prior Axis**: Fixed prior vs Universal prior (Solomonoff)

## The Correct Gate: Complement Behavior

The key distinction between Boolean and Heyting K&S is NOT about
"incomparable elements forcing interval overlap" (that claim was false).

The REAL gate is the **complement behavior**:
- **Boolean**: ν(a) + ν(¬a) = 1 (equality)
- **Heyting**: ν(a) + ν(¬a) ≤ 1 (inequality - there's slack!)

This creates natural bounds: [ν(a), 1 - ν(¬a)]
- In Boolean algebras: bounds collapse to points (equality)
- In Heyting algebras: bounds have positive width (the excluded middle gap)

## Key Vertices

- **Boolean + Point**: Classical K&S probability (standard Bayesian)
- **Boolean + 2D**: Standard probability with uncertainty quantification
- **Heyting + Point**: K&S on Heyting algebras (negation gives slack bounds)
- **Heyting + 2D**: Explicit positive/negative evidence tracking (PLN-style)

    (ν : ModularValuation α) (a : α) :

/-! ## The Heyting Bounds Construction

The natural way to get bounds from a Heyting point valuation is:
- lower(a) := ν(a)
- upper(a) := 1 - ν(¬a)

This follows from the negation inequality and gives exactly
the excluded middle gap as the interval width. -/

/-- The Heyting bounds width equals the excluded middle gap. -/
theorem heyting_bounds_width_eq_em_gap {α : Type*} [HeytingAlgebra α]
    (ν : ModularValuation α) (a : α) :
    heytingWidth ν a = excludedMiddleGap ν a :=
  heytingWidth_eq_em_gap ν a

/-- Boolean algebras have zero width (points). -/
theorem boolean_bounds_collapse {α : Type*} [BooleanAlgebra α]
    (ν : ModularValuation α) (a : α) :
    upperBound ν a = lowerBound ν a :=
  boolean_collapse ν a

/-! ## Summary: The Correct Hypercube Story

The hypercube has two main axes that matter for K&S:

1. **Logic Axis** (Boolean vs Heyting):
   - Determines the complement behavior
   - Boolean: ν(a) + ν(¬a) = 1
   - Heyting: ν(a) + ν(¬a) ≤ 1 (slack exists)

2. **Representation Axis** (Point vs Bounds/2D):
   - Point: single value ν(a)
   - Bounds: interval [lower(a), upper(a)] or 2D (n⁺, n⁻)

Key insight: These axes are INDEPENDENT!
- You can have Boolean + Bounds (imprecise probability)
- You can have Heyting + Point (K&S on Heyting algebras)

The "gate" is NOT about incomparability forcing intervals.
The gate is about complement behavior determining whether
the natural bounds [ν(a), 1 - ν(¬a)] collapse to a point.

PLN Evidence sits at Heyting + 2D because:
- Evidence is NOT Boolean (incomparable states exist)
- The 2D representation (n⁺, n⁻) tracks positive/negative evidence separately
- Collapsing to 1D loses the non-Boolean structure
