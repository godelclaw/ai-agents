# PLN Evidence as Heyting K&S Instance

## The Key Insight

PLN Evidence is NOT Boolean - it has genuinely incomparable elements.
For example: (3⁺, 2⁻) vs (2⁺, 3⁻) - neither dominates the other.

This means:
1. Evidence is a distributive lattice (PlausibilitySpace level K&S applies)
2. Evidence is NOT a ComplementedLattice / not Boolean
3. Collapsing 2D evidence to 1D "strength" loses informational distinctions

## CORRECTION

The original claim that "incomparable elements force overlapping intervals"
was FALSE. The correct characterization is:

- The difference between Boolean and Heyting is the **complement behavior**
- Boolean: ν(a) + ν(¬a) = 1
- Heyting: ν(a) + ν(¬a) ≤ 1

For PLN Evidence:
- The 2D structure (n⁺, n⁻) is the principled representation
- Collapsing to strength loses the partial order structure
- This is because strength is NOT monotone w.r.t. the Evidence order!

/-! ## Why 2D Evidence is the Right Representation

The strength function s = n⁺/(n⁺+n⁻) gives a single number.
But for incomparable evidence:
- strength(3,2) = 3/5 = 0.6
- strength(2,3) = 2/5 = 0.4

The strength "picks" an ordering (0.6 > 0.4), but this is arbitrary
for incomparable evidence. The point is NOT that "intervals must overlap"
(that was a false claim).

The real point is:
1. Evidence is NOT Boolean (incomparable elements exist)
2. Any 1D valuation will impose a total order that wasn't there
3. The 2D representation (n⁺, n⁻) preserves the partial order structure

This is why PLN uses 2D truth values - it's the principled representation
that doesn't artificially collapse the information.

/-! ## The Correct Characterization

PLN Evidence is an example of a non-Boolean lattice where:
- K&S applies at the PlausibilitySpace level
- But complement behavior is NOT Boolean

The 2D structure (n⁺, n⁻) is like tracking both "evidence for" and
"evidence against" separately, rather than assuming they sum to a constant.
-/

/-- Summary theorem: PLN Evidence has incomparable elements,
    which demonstrates it is NOT a Boolean lattice.
    The 2D representation preserves this structure. -/
theorem pln_evidence_not_boolean :
    ∃ e₁ e₂ : Evidence, Incomparable e₁ e₂ :=
  evidence_has_incomparable

/-! ## Connection to the Hypercube

In the hypercube of probability theories:
- PLN Evidence sits at the "Heyting + 2D" vertex
- It has non-Boolean complement behavior (partial order, not total)
- The 2D representation (n⁺, n⁻) is the principled choice

This is NOT because "incomparability forces intervals" (false claim),
but because:
1. Evidence has incomparable elements (proven above)
2. The 2D carrier preserves this structure
3. Collapsing to 1D loses information
