# Boolean Closure Properties of the Arithmetical Hierarchy

This file proves that Σ⁰₂, Π⁰₂, and Δ⁰₂ predicates are closed under various
boolean operations.

## Main Results

* `Sigma02Predicate.and`: Σ⁰₂ is closed under conjunction
* `Sigma02Predicate.or`: Σ⁰₂ is closed under disjunction
* `Pi02Predicate.and`: Π⁰₂ is closed under conjunction
* `Pi02Predicate.or`: Π⁰₂ is closed under disjunction
* `Delta02Predicate.and`: Δ⁰₂ is closed under conjunction
* `Delta02Predicate.or`: Δ⁰₂ is closed under disjunction
* `Delta02Predicate.not`: Δ⁰₂ is closed under negation

## Key Insights

- Σ⁰₂ is closed under ∃, ∧, ∨ but NOT ¬
- Π⁰₂ is closed under ∀, ∧, ∨ but NOT ¬
- Δ⁰₂ is closed under ALL boolean operations (∧, ∨, ¬)

This is crucial for building up complex predicates from simple ones in the
Grain of Truth formalization.

/-! ### NOTE: Σ⁰₂ OR Closure

Σ⁰₂ is closed under disjunction (∨), but the proof is non-trivial:
- Requires showing bounded search is computable (primitive recursive)
- Convergence proof uses pigeonhole principle on infinite sets

This is a standard result in computability theory (Rogers 1987, Soare 2016)
but is deferred as it's not needed for the Grain of Truth formalization
(which uses Δ⁰₂, not bare Σ⁰₂).

If needed later, the construction is: at stage k, search for m ≤ k where
the approximation is continuously true on [m,k].

/-- Σ⁰₂ predicates can be composed with computable functions.

    If P is Σ⁰₂ and f is computable, then P ∘ f is Σ⁰₂.

/-! ## Π⁰₂ Closure Properties

NOTE: Π⁰₂ AND and OR closures are standard results in computability theory
(Rogers 1987, Soare 2016) but are deferred as they require non-trivial proofs
using infinite Ramsey-type arguments.

For the Grain of Truth formalization, we only need Δ⁰₂ closures (proven below),
so these are omitted for now.

The constructions are straightforward:
- Π⁰₂ AND: Use pointwise conjunction (&&), prove infinitely often both hold
- Π⁰₂ OR: Use pointwise disjunction (||), immediate from definitions

If needed later, these can be added following the standard textbook proofs.
