# Probabilistic Turing Machines

This file defines probabilistic Turing machines using Mathlib's `Nat.Partrec.Code`
combined with the random bit stream from `CantorSpace`.

## Main Definitions

* `PTM`: A probabilistic Turing machine is a partial recursive code that reads random bits
* `PTM.runN`: Run a PTM for n steps with bounded fuel
* `PTM.outputProb`: The probability that the machine outputs a given value

## Implementation Notes

We model a probabilistic TM as a function that takes:
1. An input `x : ℕ` (encoded)
2. A random bit stream `r : CantorSpace` (infinite random bits)

The machine can query `r i` to get the i-th random bit. The computation is deterministic
given the random bits; randomness comes from the fair coin measure on CantorSpace.

## Mathematical Model

For a PTM M and input x:
- `outputProb M x k` = μ({r ∈ CantorSpace | M(x, r) terminates with output k})

where μ is the fair coin measure on Cantor space.

/-! ## Probabilistic Turing Machines -/

/-- A probabilistic Turing machine index.

We represent a PTM as a `Nat.Partrec.Code` that takes a pair (input, random_bits_used_so_far).
The random bits are encoded as a natural number (binary representation).

/-- Encode the first n bits of a random sequence as a natural number. -/
def encodeRandomBits (r : CantorSpace) (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  (List.finRange n).foldl (fun acc i => acc * 2 + if r i then 1 else 0) 0

/-- Run a PTM for at most k steps with n random bits.

This is a bounded, decidable approximation of PTM execution.
Returns `some output` if the machine halts, `none` if it needs more time/bits.

def PTMHaltsWithOutput (M : PTMIndex) (x : ℕ) (r : CantorSpace) (k : ℕ) : Prop :=

def outputZeroSet (M : PTMIndex) (x : ℕ) : Set CantorSpace :=

/-! ## Measurability

We prove that the output sets are measurable, which allows us to define probabilities.
-/

/-- The encoding of random bits depends only on the first numBits.

The foldl over finRange numBits only accesses indices i with i < numBits.
Since r₁ and r₂ agree on these indices, the encoded results are equal.

For practical proofs, we work with bounded approximations of output probability.

/-- Bounded approximations are monotone in fuel. -/
theorem boundedOutputProb_mono_fuel (M : PTMIndex) (x : ℕ) (numBits : ℕ)
    {fuel₁ fuel₂ : ℕ} (h : fuel₁ ≤ fuel₂) :
    boundedOutputProb M x fuel₁ numBits ≤ boundedOutputProb M x fuel₂ numBits := by
  -- More fuel can only add halting runs, not remove them
  unfold boundedOutputProb

  -- Use evaln_mono: if evaln k₁ c n = some x, then evaln k₂ c n = some x for k₂ ≥ k₁
  unfold runPTMBounded at hr ⊢
  have h_mem : (1 : ℕ) ∈ Nat.Partrec.Code.evaln fuel₁ M (Nat.pair x (encodeRandomBits r numBits)) := hr
  exact Nat.Partrec.Code.evaln_mono h h_mem

/-- Bounded approximations converge to the true probability.

NOTE: This theorem requires a modeling assumption about "well-behaved" PTMs that
only read the random bits they actually need. In the current encoding where
`encodeRandomBits r numBits` packs the first numBits into a single ℕ, changing
numBits changes the encoded value entirely. A "proper" PTM that reads bits
sequentially and halts once it has enough information would satisfy:
- If halts with (fuel, numBits), then halts with same output for (fuel', numBits') when
  fuel' ≥ fuel and numBits' ≥ numBits

For now, we accept this as a fundamental property of our PTM model.

  -- The proof requires showing that for each r ∈ outputOneSet, r eventually
  -- belongs to the n-th bounded set. This follows from the definition of
  -- PTMHaltsWithOutput plus a modeling assumption about sequential bit reading.
  -- Key steps:
  -- 1. outputOneSet M x = ⋃ (fuel numBits : ℕ), {r | runPTMBounded M x r fuel numBits = some 1}
  -- 2. The diagonal sets {r | runPTMBounded M x r n n = some 1} eventually cover outputOneSet
  -- 3. Use MeasureTheory.tendsto_measure_iUnion for continuity from below
  sorry

/-! ## Connection to Reflective Oracles

The key property for reflective oracles is that we can compute/approximate
the output probability from below and above.
-/

/-- The output probability can be approximated from below computably.

This is the "limit computability" property: there's a computable sequence
converging to the true probability from below.

The approximating function f(n) counts, for each n, the fraction of n-bit
random strings for which the machine halts with output 1 within n steps:
  f(n) = |{bits ∈ {0,1}^n | runPTMBounded M x r_bits n n = some 1}| / 2^n

This is computable (enumerate all 2^n bit strings, run the machine) and
monotone (under the "well-behaved PTM" assumption from boundedOutputProb_tendsto).
