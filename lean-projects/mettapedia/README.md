## Toolchain

- Lean 4.27.0 (see `lean-toolchain`)
- Mathlib v4.27.0 (see `lakefile.toml`)
- Local dependencies are included as subdirectories when needed (e.g., `Algebra/OrderedSemigroups/`).

## Build

```bash
cd lean-projects/mettapedia
lake update && lake exe cache get   # first-time only

export LAKE_JOBS=3
ulimit -Sv 6291456
nice -n 19 lake build
```

## Lean -> mettail-rust example

MeTTaMinimal can be exported from Lean and checked end-to-end in
`hyperon/mettail-rust`:

```bash
cd ~/claude/hyperon/mettail-rust

# Full roundtrip check (Lean export -> Rust build -> one-step rewrite check)
./scripts/roundtrip_mettaminimal.sh

# Benchmark command (default 3 runs)
./scripts/bench_mettaminimal_roundtrip.sh
```

Exporter used by the script:
- `hyperon/mettail-rust/scripts/lean/ExportMeTTaMinimalRoundTrip.lean`

## Status & review

Proof completeness varies by subproject. To check local gaps:

```bash
rg -n "sorry" Mettapedia/
```

For Knuth–Skilling specific structure and build targets, see:
`Mettapedia/ProbabilityTheory/KnuthSkilling/README.md`.

## Contributing

1. Keep proofs explicit; avoid axioms unless clearly justified.
2. Document sources in theorem headers.
3. Build frequently (`lake build`).
